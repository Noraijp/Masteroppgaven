abstract = {A new method for unfolding y-ray spectra is described. The method is based on the fact that the contribution of Compton scattered -y-rays in the spectra is a slowly varying function of energy. Thus, the Compton part can be smoothed and subtracted from the original observed spectrum giving an unfolded spectrum with the same statistical fluctuations as the observed spectrum. In particular, we show that the method works very well for poor statistics continuum 'y-ray spectra.},

@article{Gutfilen2018,
abstract = {Ongoing studies of physiological and pathological processes have led to a corresponding need for new radiopharmaceuticals, especially when studies are limited by the absence of a particular radiolabeled target. Thus, the development of new radioactive tracers is highly relevant and can represent a significant contribution to efforts to elucidate important phenomena in biology. Currently, theranostics represents a new frontier in the fields of medicine and nuclear medicine, with the same compound being used for both diagnosis and treatment. In the human body, copper (Cu) is the third most abundant metal and it plays a crucial role in many biological functions. Correspondingly, in various acquired and inherited pathological conditions, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease, alterations in Cu levels have been found. Moreover, a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders are associated with higher or lower levels of Cu, as well as inappropriately bound or distributed levels of Cu in the brain. In human cells, the membrane protein, hCtr1, binds Cu in its Cu(I) oxidation state in an energy-dependent manner. Copper-64 ( 64 Cu) is a cyclotron-produced radionuclide that has exhibited physical properties that are complementary for diagnosis and/or therapeutic purposes. To date, very few reports have described the clinical development of 64 Cu as a radiotracer for cancer imaging. In this review, we highlight recent insights in our understanding and use of 64 CuCl 2 as a theranostic agent for various types of tumors. To the best of our knowledge, no adverse effects or clinically observable pharmacological effects have been described for 64 CuCl 2 in the literature. Thus, 64 Cu represents a revolutionary radiopharmaceutical for positron emission tomography imaging and opens a new era in the theranostic field.},

abstract = {The investigation of the absorption of lead by plants can be carried out quite simply by dipping them into a solution which contains a radioactive isotope of lead, and determining the radioactivity of the ash fromu various parts of the plant. In addition to its simplicity and the extraordinary rapidity with which the work can be carried out this method possesses the following ad-vantages:-(a) By mixing suitable amounts of ordinary lead with the radio-active lead isotope, one can vary the lead concentration of the solution, as it were, between very wide limits. The assimilation of lead from a N/i solution can be just as readily investigated as that from a solution many million times more dilute. (b) One can follow the change in localisation of the lead taken up by the plant, and thence draw conclusions as to the nature of its com-bination. The experiments described in this paper were so carried out, that the plants, which had been cultivated in a culture solution, were washed with distilled water, and then the roots were immersed from 1 to 48 hours in a solution containing a mixture of lead nitrate and thorium B nitrate. In most cases Vicia Faba (horse-bean) was used. After this period of immersion the individual parts of the plant were first well rinsed with distilled water, and then ignited, and the intensity of the radioactivity of the ash was determined by means of an electroscope. This latter magnitude gives directly the lead content of the ash and thus also that of the corresponding part of the plant, when we know the.radioactivity and the lead content of the solution in which the plant has been immersed. Thorium B is a transformation product of thorium emanation, and is obtained in a very simple manner. A piece of platinum foil is charged nega-Bioch. xviI 29 tively to a potential of 110 volts, say, and suspended in a vessel containing the preparation (radio-thorium, thorium X, etc.) from which the thorium emanation is generated. Under these circumstances the thorium B collects on the platinum surface, and can be removed with the aid of a few drops of dilute nitric acid. The normality as regards lead of a solution (thorium B is an isotope of lead, i.e. a substance showing completely the chemical pro-perties of lead) prepared in this way is about 10-12, and if we wish to increase it we only need add to the solution a known amount of lead nitrate. For example, if we assume that we have prepared in this manner a 10-6 N solution},

abstract = {Compact medical cyclotrons are conceived for radioisotope production in a hospital-based environment. Their design in terms of field shape, stability and radio-frequency (RF) is aimed at obtaining high intensity ({\textgreater}150 µA) beams at kinetic energies of the order of 20 MeV. To guarantee high performances, an optimization procedure during the commissioning phase is crucial as well as a regular preventive maintenance. Beyond radioisotope production, these accelerators can be the heart of a multi-disciplinary research facility once access to the beam area and beams down to the pA range are possible. The first requirement can be achieved by means of an external beam transport line, which leads the beam to a second bunker with independent access. Currents down to the pA range can be obtained by specific ion source, RF and magnetic field tuning procedures, opening the way to nuclear and detector physics, radiation protection, radiation bio-physics and ion beam analysis developments. On the basis of the experience gained with the cyclotron at the Bern University Hospital, the accelerator physics aspects of compact medical cyclotrons are discussed together with their scientific potential.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Paul1953b,
abstract = {The activation cross sections were measured for 57 elements bombarded with 14.5 Mev. neutrons from the T 3 (d, n)He 4 reaction. Thirty-eight (n, p), twenty-five (n, $\alpha$), and thirty-four (n, 2n) reactions resulting in known radioactive products with half-lives between a few seconds and a few days were observed. The counting arrangement was calibrated using samples containing standardized quantities of radioactive materials. The neutron monitor was calibrated by counting the $\alpha$-particles from the T 3 (d, n)He 4 reaction. Calculations were made of the cross sections predicted by evaporation theory and compared with the observed values. For the charged particle reactions with mass number greater than 100 the theoretical cross sections were too small. Values of $\sigma$ obs/$\sigma$ cal as high as 10,000 were obtained. However, the predicted cross sections for the (n, 2n) reactions were in general agreement with the observed values. A possible interpretation of these results is discussed.},

@book{Tavernier2010,
abstract = {The book is based on a course in nuclear and particle physics that the author has taught over many years to physics students, students in nuclear engineering and students in biomedical engineering. It provides the basic understanding that any student or researcher using such instruments and techniques should have about the subject. After an introduction to the structure of matter at the subatomic scale, it covers the experimental aspects of nuclear and particle physics. Ideally complementing a theoretically-oriented textbook on nuclear physics and/or particle physics, it introduces the reader to the different techniques used in nuclear and particle physics to accelerate particles and to measurement techniques (detectors) in nuclear and particle physics. The main subjects treated are: interactions of subatomic particles in matter; particle accelerators; basics of different types of detectors; and nuclear electronics. The book will be of interest to undergraduates, graduates and researchers in both particle and nuclear physics. For the physicists it is a good introduction to all experimental aspects of nuclear and particle physics. Nuclear engineers will appreciate the nuclear measurement techniques, while biomedical engineers can learn about measuring ionising radiation, the use of accelerators for radiotherapy. What's more, worked examples, end-of-chapter exercises, and appendices with key constants, properties and relationships supplement the textual material.},

@article{Rosch2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. In the context of radiopharmacy and molecular imaging, the concept of theranostics entails a therapy-accompanying diagnosis with the aim of a patient-specific treatment. Using the adequate diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, the disease and the state of the disease are verified for an individual patient. The other way around, it verifies that the radiopharmaceutical in hand represents a target-specific and selective molecule: the “best one” for that individual patient. Transforming diagnostic imaging into quantitative dosimetric information, the optimum radioactivity (expressed in maximum radiation dose to the target tissue and tolerable dose to healthy organs) of the adequate radiotherapeutical is applied to that individual patient. This theranostic approach in nuclear medicine is traced back to the first use of the radionuclide pair 86 Y/ 90 Y, which allowed a combination of PET and internal radiotherapy. Whereas the $\beta$-emitting therapeutic radionuclide 90 Y (t 1/2 = 2.7 d) had been available for a long time via the 90 Sr/ 90 Y generator system, the $\beta$ + emitter 86 Y (t 1/2 = 14.7 h) had to be developed for medical application. A brief outline of the various aspects of radiochemical and nuclear development work (nuclear data, cyclotron irradiation, chemical processing, quality control, etc.) is given. In parallel, the paper discusses the methodology introduced to quantify molecular imaging of 86 Y-labelled compounds in terms of multiple and long-term PET recordings. It highlights the ultimate goal of radiotheranostics, namely to extract the radiation dose of the analogue 90 Y-labelled compound in terms of mGy or mSv per MBq 90 Y injected. Finally, the current and possible future development of theranostic approaches based on different PET and therapy nuclides is discussed.},

abstract = {Electric dipole strength below the particle emission threshold both in stable nuclei and short-lived isotopes has received increasing interest due to its astrophysical impact. In analogy to the giant dipole resonance, this strength is commonly referred to as pygmy resonance. Coulomb dissociation of neutron-rich unstable isotopes and nuclear resonance fluorescence photon scattering have begun to provide systematic data on electric dipole strength in various isotope chains. We review the present state of the art of theoretical approaches and point out some open problems. We emphasize the necessity of a simultaneous theoretical treatment of the nucleon separation energies and the energetically low-lying dipole strength because the presently available data do not exclude a non-collective nature of the pygmy strength. {\textcopyright} 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first measurements of the velocity of blood flow through the lungs of man. Thorough understanding of the blood flow through the lungs is of great significance in understanding adapta-tions of the circulation in health and disease. The study of the pulmonary circulation has, therefore, always at-tracted the interest of investigators. The literature is voluminous and was reviewed in 1903 by Tigerstedt (1) and in 1921 by Wiggers (2). In animals the study of the pulmonary circulation necessitates such distortion of the normal physiological conditions that interpre-tation of the results is diflicult. The chest has usually been opened, the negative intrathoracic pressure abolished, and normal inspiration has been replaced by forcible distention of the lungs with positive blasts of air. By such methods Plunier (3) in 1904 first studied the pulmonary circulation time in animals, estimating the time between release of a previously compressed vena cava and the subsequent maximal rise in arterial pressure. G. N. Stewart (4) (19) advanced the knowledge of the pulmonary blood flow by studying the time required for dyes and salt solutions to pass from the great veins through the heart and lungs to the great arteries. The chest was not opened al-though the animals were under general anesthesia. His results will be discussed later. Because such experiments are clinically not feasible, and because I This investigation was aided},

abstract = {Values of the reduced activity resonance integral relative to the thermal cross section, I′/$\sigma$ 0 , of 96 Zr and 94 Zr were determined relative to gold by measuring cadmium ratios in a reactor spectrum.Due to the anomalous characteristics of 96 Zr a measurement of I′/$\sigma$ 0 for 96 Zr was undertaken in a "quasi" thermal spectrum. 96 Zr and 94 Zr activation resonance integrals were also determined by measuring the ratio of effective activation cross section of zirconium to 55 Mn. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) calibrated gamma sources were used to determine the samples' absolute activities. A lithium-drifted germanium $\gamma$-ray spectrometer was used in all cases to resolve the activities of the irradiated samples.The results for 96 Zr are I′/$\sigma$ 0 = 879 ± 96, I′ = 4.97 ± 0.50 b, and $\sigma$ 0 = 5.7 ± 10 mb; for 94 Zr I′/$\sigma$ 0 = 5.87 ± 0.05, I′ = 0.369 ± 0.037 b, and derived $\sigma$ 0 = 63 ± 8 mb.I′/$\sigma$ 0 for 96 Zr is an order of magnitude or more greater than that found for stable isotopes. This suggests that almost 100{\%} of the activation resonance integral of 96 Zr consists of p-neutron captures. This fact is not consistent with the present knowledge of p-strength functions in the 90 {\textless} A {\textless} 130 mass region.},

The neutron flux at energies below 5.3 MeV was determined with a calibrated neutron long counter while at higher energies measurements were made relative to the known cross section for the 32 S(n,p) 32 P reaction. Effective cross sections for a fission-neutron spectrum calculated from measured excitation curves are 42.3 ± 2.1 mb for the (n,p) reaction, 0.035 ± 0.003 mb for the (n,$\alpha$) reaction, and 0.45 ± 0.04 mb for the (n,2n) reaction. Factors influencing precise measurements of fast-neutron cross sections are discussed in detail.},

@article{Serber1947,
abstract = {When a target is bombarded with high energy deuterons, a narrow beam of high energy neutrons is produced by a process in which the proton in the deuteron strikes the edge of the nucleus and is stripped off, while the neutron misses and continues on its way. The cross section for this stripping process is =12RRd, where R is the nuclear radius and Rd is the deuteron radius, or =5A13×10-26 cm2. The yield of neutrons from a -in. Be target (in which the energy loss for 190-Mev deuterons is 20 Mev) is nearly 2 percent. The neutrons come out with an energy spread around 12Ed having a half-width E12=1.5(Edd)12. Here Ed is the kinetic energy of the deuteron, d its binding energy. For light nuclei the half-width of the neutron angular distribution is 12=1.6(dEd)12. The half-width increases somewhat with atomic number, primarily because of the deflection of the deuteron by the Coulomb field as it approaches the nucleus, and, to a lesser extent, because of multiple scattering in the target. The increase in half-width from Be to U is about 25 percent. The calculated halfwidths and angular distributions agree well with the measurements of Helmholz, McMillan, and Sewell. An equal number of high energy protons are produced by stripping processes in which it is the neutron that hits the nucleus. {\textcopyright} 1947 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Caserta2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by The American Society of Hematology. As a growing number of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) respond to upfront therapies while eventually relapsing in a time frame that is often unpredictable, attention has increasingly focused on developing novel diagnostic criteria to also account for disease dissemination. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is often used as a noninvasive monitoring strategy to assess cancer cell dissemination, but because the uptake of the currently used radiotracer 18fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is a function of the metabolic activity of both malignant and nonmalignant cells, the results frequently lack sufficient specificity. Radiolabeled antibodies targeting MM tissue may detect disease irrespective of cell metabolism. Hence, we conjugated the clinically significant CD38-directed human antibody daratumumab (Darzalex [Dara]) to the DOTA chelator and labeled it with the positron-emitting radionuclide copper 64 (64Cu; 64Cu-DOTA-Dara). Here, we show that 64Cu-DOTA-Dara can efficiently bind CD38 on the surface ofMMcells and was mainly detected in the bones associated with tumor in a MM murine model. We also show that PET/CT based on 64Cu-DOTA-Dara displays a higher resolution and specificity to detectMMcell dissemination than does 18F-FDG PET/CT and was even more sensitive than were bioluminescence signals. We therefore have supporting evidence for using 64Cu-DOTA-Dara as a novel imaging agent for MM.},

The measurements are relative to the known cross section for the reaction S 32 (n, p)P 32 . Monoenergetic neutrons were obtained from the D(d, n)He 3 , T(d, n)He 4 , and the T(p, n)He 3 reactions employing a Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator or 125-kev accelerator. Cross sections for both reactions rise above the minimum detectable value of 0.02 mb near 5 Mev and reach maximum values of 126 mb for the Al(n, $\alpha$)Na 24 reaction and 205 mb for the Mg 24 (n, p)Na 24 reaction at 13.5 Mev. Above this energy both cross sections decrease. From the excitation curves effective cross-section values for a fission-neutron spectrum have been calculated as 0.61 ± 0.03 mb for the (n, $\alpha$) reaction and 1.34 ± 0.07 mb for the (n, p) reaction.},

@article{Skuldt2016,
abstract = {Aim, method: The scientific publications in the 2003 and 2004 issues of the journal Nuklearmedizin were analyzed retrospectively with regard to the proportion of medical technology research. Results: Out of a total of 73 articles examined, 9 (12{\%}) were classified as medical technology research, that is, 8/15 of the original papers (16{\%}) and one of the case reports (5{\%}). Of these 9 articles, 44{\%} (4/9) focused on the combination of molecular and morphological imaging with direct technical appliance or information technology solutions. Conclusion: Medical technology research is limited in the journal's catchment area. The reason for this is related to the interdependency between divergent development dynamics in the medical technology industry's locations, the many years that the area of scintigraphic technology has been underrepresented, research policy particularly in discrepancies in the promotion of molecular imaging and a policy in which health is not perceived as a predominantly good and positive oeconomic factor, but more as a curb to oeconomic development.},

@article{Qaim2017,
abstract = {Introduction The significance of nuclear data in the choice and medical application of a radionuclide is considered: the decay data determine its suitability for organ imaging or internal therapy and the reaction cross section data allow optimisation of its production route. A brief discussion of reaction cross sections and yields is given. Standard radionuclides The standard SPECT, PET and therapeutic radionuclides are enumerated and their decay and production data are considered. The status of nuclear data is generally good. Some existing discrepancies are outlined. A few promising alternative production routes of 99mTc and 68Ga are discussed. Research-oriented radionuclides The increasing significance of non-standard positron emitters in organ imaging and of low-energy highly-ionizing radiation emitters in internal therapy is discussed, their nuclear data are considered and a brief review of their status is presented. Some other related nuclear data issues are also mentioned. Production of radionuclides using newer technologies The data needs arising from new directions in radionuclide applications (multimode imaging, theranostic approach, radionanoparticles, etc.) are considered. The future needs of data associated with possible utilization of newer irradiation technologies (intermediate energy cyclotron, high-intensity photon accelerator, spallation neutron source, etc.) are outlined. Conclusion Except for a few small discrepancies, the available nuclear data are sufficient for routine production and application of radionuclides. Considerable data needs exist for developing novel radionuclides for applications. The developing future technologies for radionuclide production will demand further data-related activities.},

The 88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is a sector-focused cyclotron and home of the Berkeley Accelerator Space Effects Facility, where the effects of energetic particles on sensitive microelectronics are studied with the goal of designing electronic systems for the space community. This paper describes the flexibility of the facility and its capabilities for testing the bombardment of electronics by heavy ions, light ions, and neutrons. Experimental capabilities for the generation of neutron beams from deuteron breakups and radiation testing of carbon nanotube field effect transistor will be discussed.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: In recent years, (47)Sc has attracted attention because of its favorable decay characteristics (half-life, 3.35 d; average energy, 162 keV; E$\gamma$, 159 keV) for therapeutic application and for SPECT imaging. The aim of the present study was to investigate the suitability of (47)Sc for radionuclide therapy in a preclinical setting. For this purpose a novel DOTA-folate conjugate (cm10) with an albumin-binding entity was used.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: (47)Sc was produced via the (46)Ca(n,$\gamma$)(47)Ca[Formula: see text](47)Sc nuclear reaction at the high-flux reactor at the Institut Laue-Langevin. Separation of the (47)Sc from the target material was performed by a semi-automated process using extraction chromatography and cation exchange chromatography. (47)Sc-labeled cm10 was tested on folate receptor-positive KB tumor cells in vitro. Biodistribution and SPECT imaging experiments were performed in KB tumor-bearing mice. Radionuclide therapy was conducted with two groups of mice, which received either (47)Sc-cm10 (10 MBq) or only saline. Tumor growth and survival time were compared between the two groups of mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Irradiation of (46)Ca resulted in approximately 1.8 GBq of (47)Ca, which subsequently decayed to (47)Sc. Separation of (47)Sc from (47)Ca was obtained with 80{\%} yield in only 10 min. The (47)Sc was then available in a small volume (∼500 $\mu$L) of an ammonium acetate/HCl (pH 4.5) solution suitable for direct radiolabeling. (47)Sc-cm10 was prepared with a radiochemical yield of more than 96{\%} at a specific activity of up to 13 MBq/nmol. In vitro (47)Sc-cm10 showed folate receptor-specific binding and uptake into KB tumor cells. In vivo SPECT/CT images allowed the visualization of accumulated radioactivity in KB tumors and in the kidneys. The therapy study showed a significantly delayed tumor growth in mice, which received (47)Sc-cm10 (10 MBq, 10 Gy) resulting in a more than 50{\%} increase in survival time, compared with untreated control mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: With this study, we demonstrated the suitability of using (47)Sc for therapeutic purposes. On the basis of our recent results obtained with (44)Sc-folate, the present work confirms the applicability of (44)Sc/(47)Sc as an excellent matched pair of nuclides for PET imaging and radionuclide therapy.},

@article{rainier,
abstract = {A new code has been developed named RAINIER that simulates the $\gamma$-ray decay of discrete and quasi-continuum nuclear levels for a user-specified range of energy, angular momentum, and parity including a realistic treatment of level spacing and transition width fluctuations. A similar program, DICEBOX, uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate level and width fluctuations but is restricted in its initial level population algorithm. On the other hand, modern reaction codes such as TALYS and EMPIRE populate a wide range of states in the residual nucleus prior to $\gamma$-ray decay, but do not go beyond the use of deterministic functions and therefore neglect cascade fluctuations. This combination of capabilities allows RAINIER to be used to determine quasi-continuum properties through comparison with experimental data. Several examples are given that demonstrate how cascade fluctuations influence experimental high-resolution $\gamma$-ray spectra from reactions that populate a wide range of initial states.},

abstract = {The growing advancement in nuclear medicine challenges researchers from several different fields to integrate imaging and therapeutic modalities in a theranostic radiopharmaceutical, which can be defined as a molecular entity with readily replaceable radioisotope to provide easy switch between diagnostic and therapeutic applications for efficient and patient-friendly treatment of diseases. For such a reason, the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of all five medical radionuclides of copper have thoroughly been investigated as they boost the hope for development of successful radiotheranostics. To facilitate the mutual understanding between all different specialists working on this multidisciplinary field, we summarized the recent updates in copper-based nuclear medicine, with specific attention to the potential theranostic applications. Thereby, this review paper is focused on the current achievements in the copper-related complementary fields, such as synthetic and nuclear chemistry, biological assessment of radiopharmaceuticals, design and development of nanomaterials for multimodal theranostic implications. This work includes: i) description of available copper radionuclide production methods; ii) analyses of the synthetic strategies for development of improved copper radiopharmaceuticals; iii) summary of reported clinical data and recent preclinical studies from the last five years on biological applicability of copper radiopharmaceuticals; and iv) illustration of some sophisticated multimodal nanotheranostic agents that comprise several imaging and therapeutic modalities. Significant advancement can be seen in the synthetic procedures, which enables the broader implication of pretargeting approaches via bioorthogonal click reactions, as well as in the nanotechnology methods for biomimetic construction of biocompatible multimodal copper theranostics. All this gives the hope that personalized treatment of various diseases can be achieved by copper theranostics in the near future.},

abstract = {The activation cross sections were measured for 57 elements bombarded with 14.5 Mev. neutrons from the T 3 (d, n)He 4 reaction. Thirty-eight (n, p), twenty-five (n, $\alpha$), and thirty-four (n, 2n) reactions resulting in known radioactive products with half-lives between a few seconds and a few days were observed. The counting arrangement was calibrated using samples containing standardized quantities of radioactive materials. The neutron monitor was calibrated by counting the $\alpha$-particles from the T 3 (d, n)He 4 reaction. Calculations were made of the cross sections predicted by evaporation theory and compared with the observed values. For the charged particle reactions with mass number greater than 100 the theoretical cross sections were too small. Values of $\sigma$ obs/$\sigma$ cal as high as 10,000 were obtained. However, the predicted cross sections for the (n, 2n) reactions were in general agreement with the observed values. A possible interpretation of these results is discussed.},

@article{PET_alzimer,
abstract = {While current international guidelines include imaging of the target lesion for response monitoring in metastatic breast cancer, they do not provide specific recommendations for choice of imaging modality or response criteria. This is important as clinical decisions may vary depending on which imaging modality is used for monitoring metastatic breast cancer. FDG-PET/CT has shown high accuracy in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer, and the Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) have shown higher predictive values than the CT-based Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for prediction of progression-free survival. No studies have yet addressed the clinical impact of using different imaging modalities or response evaluation criteria for longitudinal response monitoring in metastatic breast cancer. We present a case study of a patient with metastatic breast cancer who was monitored first with conventional CT and then with FDG-PET/CT. We retrospectively applied PERCIST to evaluate the longitudinal response to treatment. We used the one-lesion PERCIST model measuring SULpeak in the hottest metastatic lesion on consecutive scans. This model provides a continuous variable that allows graphical illustration of disease fluctuation along with response categories. The one-lesion PERCIST approach seems able to reflect molecular changes and has the potential to support clinical decision-making. Prospective clinical studies addressing the clinical impact of PERCIST in metastatic breast cancer are needed to establish evidence-based recommendations for response monitoring in this disease.},

abstract = {Values of the reduced activity resonance integral relative to the thermal cross section, I′/$\sigma$ 0 , of 96 Zr and 94 Zr were determined relative to gold by measuring cadmium ratios in a reactor spectrum.Due to the anomalous characteristics of 96 Zr a measurement of I′/$\sigma$ 0 for 96 Zr was undertaken in a "quasi" thermal spectrum. 96 Zr and 94 Zr activation resonance integrals were also determined by measuring the ratio of effective activation cross section of zirconium to 55 Mn. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) calibrated gamma sources were used to determine the samples' absolute activities. A lithium-drifted germanium $\gamma$-ray spectrometer was used in all cases to resolve the activities of the irradiated samples.The results for 96 Zr are I′/$\sigma$ 0 = 879 ± 96, I′ = 4.97 ± 0.50 b, and $\sigma$ 0 = 5.7 ± 10 mb; for 94 Zr I′/$\sigma$ 0 = 5.87 ± 0.05, I′ = 0.369 ± 0.037 b, and derived $\sigma$ 0 = 63 ± 8 mb.I′/$\sigma$ 0 for 96 Zr is an order of magnitude or more greater than that found for stable isotopes. This suggests that almost 100{\%} of the activation resonance integral of 96 Zr consists of p-neutron captures. This fact is not consistent with the present knowledge of p-strength functions in the 90 {\textless} A {\textless} 130 mass region.},

abstract = {It has long been known that thorium-232 is a fertile radioactive material that can produce energy in nuclear reactors for conversion to electricity. Thorium-232 is well suited to a variety of reactor types including molten fluoride salt designs, heavy water CANDU configurations, and helium-cooled TRISO-fueled systems. Among contentious commercial nuclear power issues are the questions of what to do with long-lived radioactive waste and how to minimize weapon proliferation dangers. The substitution of thorium for uranium as fuel in nuclear reactors has significant potential for minimizing both problems. Thorium is three times more abundant in nature than uranium. Whereas uranium has to be imported, there is enough thorium in the United States alone to provide adequate grid power for many centuries. A well-designed thorium reactor could produce electricity less expensively than a next-generation coal-fired plant or a current-generation uranium-fueled nuclear reactor. Importantly, thorium reactors produce substantially less long-lived radioactive waste than uranium reactors. Thorium-fueled reactors with molten salt configurations and very high temperature thorium-based TRISO-fueled reactors are both recommended for priority Generation IV funding in the 2030 time frame. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Endres2012,
abstract = {Background: In atomic nuclei, a concentration of electric dipole strength around the particle threshold, commonly denoted as pygmy dipole resonance, may have a significant impact on nuclear structure properties and astrophysical scenarios. A clear identification of these states and the structure of this resonance is still under discussion. Purpose: We present an experimental and theoretical study of the isospin character of the pygmy dipole resonance and investigation of a splitting of the electric dipole strength previously observed in experiments on N=82 nuclei. Method: The pygmy dipole resonance has been studied in the semi-magic Z=50 nucleus 124Sn by means of the ($\alpha$,$\alpha$′$\gamma$) coincidence method at E $\alpha$=136MeV using the Big-Bite Spectrometer at the Kernfysisch Versneller Instituut in Groningen, The Netherlands. Results: A splitting of the low-energy part of the electric dipole strength was identified in 124Sn by comparing the differential cross sections measured in ($\alpha$,$\alpha$′$\gamma$) to results stemming from ($\gamma$,$\gamma$′) photon-scattering experiments. While an energetically lower-lying group of states is observed in both kinds of experiments, a higher-lying group of states is only excited in the ($\gamma$,$\gamma$′) reaction. In addition, theoretical calculations using the self-consistent relativistic quasiparticle time-blocking approximation and the quasiparticle-phonon model have been performed. Both calculations show a qualitative agreement with the experimental data and predict a low-lying isoscalar component that is dominated by neutron-skin oscillations as expected for the pygmy dipole resonance. Furthermore, the states at higher energies show a pronounced isovector component and a different radial dependence of the corresponding transition densities as expected for the tail of the giant dipole resonance. Conclusions: An experimental signature of the neutron-skin oscillation of the pygmy dipole resonance has been corroborated. The combination of the presented reactions might make it possible to identify states of this resonance. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},
