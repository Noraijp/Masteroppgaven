@article{Caserta2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by The American Society of Hematology. As a growing number of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) respond to upfront therapies while eventually relapsing in a time frame that is often unpredictable, attention has increasingly focused on developing novel diagnostic criteria to also account for disease dissemination. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is often used as a noninvasive monitoring strategy to assess cancer cell dissemination, but because the uptake of the currently used radiotracer 18fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is a function of the metabolic activity of both malignant and nonmalignant cells, the results frequently lack sufficient specificity. Radiolabeled antibodies targeting MM tissue may detect disease irrespective of cell metabolism. Hence, we conjugated the clinically significant CD38-directed human antibody daratumumab (Darzalex [Dara]) to the DOTA chelator and labeled it with the positron-emitting radionuclide copper 64 (64Cu; 64Cu-DOTA-Dara). Here, we show that 64Cu-DOTA-Dara can efficiently bind CD38 on the surface ofMMcells and was mainly detected in the bones associated with tumor in a MM murine model. We also show that PET/CT based on 64Cu-DOTA-Dara displays a higher resolution and specificity to detectMMcell dissemination than does 18F-FDG PET/CT and was even more sensitive than were bioluminescence signals. We therefore have supporting evidence for using 64Cu-DOTA-Dara as a novel imaging agent for MM.},

@book{Tavernier2010,
abstract = {The book is based on a course in nuclear and particle physics that the author has taught over many years to physics students, students in nuclear engineering and students in biomedical engineering. It provides the basic understanding that any student or researcher using such instruments and techniques should have about the subject. After an introduction to the structure of matter at the subatomic scale, it covers the experimental aspects of nuclear and particle physics. Ideally complementing a theoretically-oriented textbook on nuclear physics and/or particle physics, it introduces the reader to the different techniques used in nuclear and particle physics to accelerate particles and to measurement techniques (detectors) in nuclear and particle physics. The main subjects treated are: interactions of subatomic particles in matter; particle accelerators; basics of different types of detectors; and nuclear electronics. The book will be of interest to undergraduates, graduates and researchers in both particle and nuclear physics. For the physicists it is a good introduction to all experimental aspects of nuclear and particle physics. Nuclear engineers will appreciate the nuclear measurement techniques, while biomedical engineers can learn about measuring ionising radiation, the use of accelerators for radiotherapy. What's more, worked examples, end-of-chapter exercises, and appendices with key constants, properties and relationships supplement the textual material.},

The method is based on the fact that the contribution of Compton scattered -y-rays in the spectra is a slowly varying function of energy. Thus, the Compton part can be smoothed and subtracted from the original observed spectrum giving an unfolded spectrum with the same statistical fluctuations as the observed spectrum. In particular, we show that the method works very well for poor statistics continuum 'y-ray spectra.},

abstract = {A new code has been developed named RAINIER that simulates the $\gamma$-ray decay of discrete and quasi-continuum nuclear levels for a user-specified range of energy, angular momentum, and parity including a realistic treatment of level spacing and transition width fluctuations. A similar program, DICEBOX, uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate level and width fluctuations but is restricted in its initial level population algorithm. On the other hand, modern reaction codes such as TALYS and EMPIRE populate a wide range of states in the residual nucleus prior to $\gamma$-ray decay, but do not go beyond the use of deterministic functions and therefore neglect cascade fluctuations. This combination of capabilities allows RAINIER to be used to determine quasi-continuum properties through comparison with experimental data. Several examples are given that demonstrate how cascade fluctuations influence experimental high-resolution $\gamma$-ray spectra from reactions that populate a wide range of initial states.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: In recent years, (47)Sc has attracted attention because of its favorable decay characteristics (half-life, 3.35 d; average energy, 162 keV; E$\gamma$, 159 keV) for therapeutic application and for SPECT imaging. The aim of the present study was to investigate the suitability of (47)Sc for radionuclide therapy in a preclinical setting. For this purpose a novel DOTA-folate conjugate (cm10) with an albumin-binding entity was used.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: (47)Sc was produced via the (46)Ca(n,$\gamma$)(47)Ca[Formula: see text](47)Sc nuclear reaction at the high-flux reactor at the Institut Laue-Langevin. Separation of the (47)Sc from the target material was performed by a semi-automated process using extraction chromatography and cation exchange chromatography. (47)Sc-labeled cm10 was tested on folate receptor-positive KB tumor cells in vitro. Biodistribution and SPECT imaging experiments were performed in KB tumor-bearing mice. Radionuclide therapy was conducted with two groups of mice, which received either (47)Sc-cm10 (10 MBq) or only saline. Tumor growth and survival time were compared between the two groups of mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Irradiation of (46)Ca resulted in approximately 1.8 GBq of (47)Ca, which subsequently decayed to (47)Sc. Separation of (47)Sc from (47)Ca was obtained with 80{\%} yield in only 10 min. The (47)Sc was then available in a small volume (∼500 $\mu$L) of an ammonium acetate/HCl (pH 4.5) solution suitable for direct radiolabeling. (47)Sc-cm10 was prepared with a radiochemical yield of more than 96{\%} at a specific activity of up to 13 MBq/nmol. In vitro (47)Sc-cm10 showed folate receptor-specific binding and uptake into KB tumor cells. In vivo SPECT/CT images allowed the visualization of accumulated radioactivity in KB tumors and in the kidneys. The therapy study showed a significantly delayed tumor growth in mice, which received (47)Sc-cm10 (10 MBq, 10 Gy) resulting in a more than 50{\%} increase in survival time, compared with untreated control mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: With this study, we demonstrated the suitability of using (47)Sc for therapeutic purposes. On the basis of our recent results obtained with (44)Sc-folate, the present work confirms the applicability of (44)Sc/(47)Sc as an excellent matched pair of nuclides for PET imaging and radionuclide therapy.},

abstract = {Introduction The significance of nuclear data in the choice and medical application of a radionuclide is considered: the decay data determine its suitability for organ imaging or internal therapy and the reaction cross section data allow optimisation of its production route. A brief discussion of reaction cross sections and yields is given. Standard radionuclides The standard SPECT, PET and therapeutic radionuclides are enumerated and their decay and production data are considered. The status of nuclear data is generally good. Some existing discrepancies are outlined. A few promising alternative production routes of 99mTc and 68Ga are discussed. Research-oriented radionuclides The increasing significance of non-standard positron emitters in organ imaging and of low-energy highly-ionizing radiation emitters in internal therapy is discussed, their nuclear data are considered and a brief review of their status is presented. Some other related nuclear data issues are also mentioned. Production of radionuclides using newer technologies The data needs arising from new directions in radionuclide applications (multimode imaging, theranostic approach, radionanoparticles, etc.) are considered. The future needs of data associated with possible utilization of newer irradiation technologies (intermediate energy cyclotron, high-intensity photon accelerator, spallation neutron source, etc.) are outlined. Conclusion Except for a few small discrepancies, the available nuclear data are sufficient for routine production and application of radionuclides. Considerable data needs exist for developing novel radionuclides for applications. The developing future technologies for radionuclide production will demand further data-related activities.},

@article{Rosch2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. In the context of radiopharmacy and molecular imaging, the concept of theranostics entails a therapy-accompanying diagnosis with the aim of a patient-specific treatment. Using the adequate diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, the disease and the state of the disease are verified for an individual patient. The other way around, it verifies that the radiopharmaceutical in hand represents a target-specific and selective molecule: the “best one” for that individual patient. Transforming diagnostic imaging into quantitative dosimetric information, the optimum radioactivity (expressed in maximum radiation dose to the target tissue and tolerable dose to healthy organs) of the adequate radiotherapeutical is applied to that individual patient. This theranostic approach in nuclear medicine is traced back to the first use of the radionuclide pair 86 Y/ 90 Y, which allowed a combination of PET and internal radiotherapy. Whereas the $\beta$-emitting therapeutic radionuclide 90 Y (t 1/2 = 2.7 d) had been available for a long time via the 90 Sr/ 90 Y generator system, the $\beta$ + emitter 86 Y (t 1/2 = 14.7 h) had to be developed for medical application. A brief outline of the various aspects of radiochemical and nuclear development work (nuclear data, cyclotron irradiation, chemical processing, quality control, etc.) is given. In parallel, the paper discusses the methodology introduced to quantify molecular imaging of 86 Y-labelled compounds in terms of multiple and long-term PET recordings. It highlights the ultimate goal of radiotheranostics, namely to extract the radiation dose of the analogue 90 Y-labelled compound in terms of mGy or mSv per MBq 90 Y injected. Finally, the current and possible future development of theranostic approaches based on different PET and therapy nuclides is discussed.},
