@article{rainier,
abstract = {A new code has been developed named RAINIER that simulates the $\gamma$-ray decay of discrete and quasi-continuum nuclear levels for a user-specified range of energy, angular momentum, and parity including a realistic treatment of level spacing and transition width fluctuations. A similar program, DICEBOX, uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate level and width fluctuations but is restricted in its initial level population algorithm. On the other hand, modern reaction codes such as TALYS and EMPIRE populate a wide range of states in the residual nucleus prior to $\gamma$-ray decay, but do not go beyond the use of deterministic functions and therefore neglect cascade fluctuations. This combination of capabilities allows RAINIER to be used to determine quasi-continuum properties through comparison with experimental data. Several examples are given that demonstrate how cascade fluctuations influence experimental high-resolution $\gamma$-ray spectra from reactions that populate a wide range of initial states.},

@article{Unfolding,
abstract = {A new method for unfolding y-ray spectra is described. The method is based on the fact that the contribution of Compton scattered -y-rays in the spectra is a slowly varying function of energy. Thus, the Compton part can be smoothed and subtracted from the original observed spectrum giving an unfolded spectrum with the same statistical fluctuations as the observed spectrum. In particular, we show that the method works very well for poor statistics continuum 'y-ray spectra.},
