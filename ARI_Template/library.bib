abstract = {Abstract New excitation functions for proton induced nuclear reactions on natural titanium, nickel and copper were measured, using the stacked-foil technique and gamma spectrometry, up to 70MeV. The experimental cross sections were measured using the Ti-nat(p,x) V-48, Ni-nat(p,x) Ni-57 and Cu-nat(p,x) Zn-62,Co-56 monitor reactions recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), depending on the investigated energy range. Data have been extracted for the Ti-nat(p,x) Sc-43,44m,46,47,48, V-48, K-42,43, Ni-nat(p,x) Ni-56,57, Co-55,56,57,58, Mn-52,54, Cu-nat(p,x) Cu-61,64, Ni-57, Co-56,57,58,60, Zn-62,65, Mn-54 reactions. Our results are discussed and compared to the existing ones as well as with the TALYS code version 1.6 calculations using default models. Our experimental data are in overall good agreement with the literature. TALYS is able to reproduce, in most cases, the experimental trend. Our new experimental results allow to expand our knowledge on these excitation functions, to confirm the existing trends and to give additional values on a large energy range. This work is in line with the new Coordinated Research Project (CRP) launched by the IAEA to expand the database of monitor reactions.},

abstract = {Ionising radiations have dramatic effects on the properties of polymers commonly used in hard radiation environments. From the early radiolysis studies, polymers have been classified into those undergoing mainly chain scissions and those being cross-linked. Real situations are however far more complex due to the semi-crystalline organisation of most polymers implying transition temperatures (glass transition, fusion temperature of the crystalline fraction), oxygen diffusion driven formation of oxidised species and effects of the polymer formulation (anti-oxidants, influence of the fillers). Progress has been made in the understanding of such phenomena and different examples have been considered illustrating the different faces of the polymer evolution under ionising radiation. Particular emphasis has been given to the changes of the final polymer properties in their conditions of use. Two examples of materials of widespread importance in nuclear technology: elastomers and epoxy resins, will be discussed.},

@article{Gibson2006,
abstract = {Radionuclide Therapy (RNT) and Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) are potentially of great interest for cancer therapy. In many therapeutic applications alpha emitters should be much more effective than already-approved beta emitters due to the short range and high linear energy transfer of alpha particles. 213 Bi is an important alpha emitter already used in clinical trials but the half-life of this radioisotope is short (46 minutes) and so its use is limited for certain therapies. 211 At is potentially very interesting for medical purposes because of its longer half-life of 7.2 hours, and suitable decay scheme. We have studied the cyclotron-based production of 211 At via the reaction 209 Bi($\alpha$, 2n), this production route probably being the most promising in the long term. The energy dependence of thick target yields and the reaction cross sections for the production of 211 At and 210 At were determined and found to be in good agreement with literature. The best energy to produce 211 At is 28-29 MeV. The possible production of the undesired, highly radiotoxic, and long-lived alpha-emitting 210 Po (138.38 days), which is produced from decay of 210 At, is also discussed.},

abstract = {A new internal conversion coefficient database, BrIcc has been developed which integrates a number of tabulations on internal conversion electron (ICC) and electron-positron pair conversion coefficients (IPC), as well as $\Omega$ (E 0) electronic factors. A critical review of general formulae and procedures to evaluate theoretical ICC and IPC values are presented, including the treatment of uncertainties in transition energy and mixing ratio in accordance with the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File. The default ICC table, based on the Dirac-Fock calculations using the so called "Frozen Orbital" approximation, takes into account the effect of atomic vacancies created in the conversion process. The table has been calculated for all atomic shells and to cover transition energies of 1-6000 keV and atomic numbers of Z = 5-110. The software tools presented here are well suited for basic nuclear structure research and for a range of applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In lymphoid malignancies and in certain solid cancers such as medullary thyroid carcinoma, somewhat mixed success has been achieved when applying radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with $\beta$-emitters for the treatment of refractory cases. The development of novel RIT with $\alpha$-emitters has created new opportunities and theoretical advantages due to the high linear energy transfer (LET) and the short path length in biological tissue of $\alpha$-particles. These physical properties offer the prospect of achieving selective tumoural cell killing. Thus, RIT with $\alpha$-emitters appears particularly suited for the elimination of circulating single cells or cell clusters or for the treatment of micrometastases at an early stage. However, to avoid non-specific irradiation of healthy tissues, it is necessary to identify accessible tumoural targets easily and rapidly. For this purpose, a small number of $\alpha$-emitters have been investigated, among which only a few have been used for in vivo preclinical studies. Another problem is the availability and cost of these radionuclides; for instance, the low cost and the development of a reliable actinium-225/bismuth-213 generator were probably determining elements in the choice of bismuth-213 in the only human trial of RIT with an $\alpha$-emitter. This article reviews the literature concerning monoclonal antibodies radiolabelled with $\alpha$-emitters that have been developed for possible RIT in cancer patients. The principal radio-immunoconjugates are considered, starting with physical and chemical properties of $\alpha$-emitters, their mode of production, the possibilities and difficulties of labelling, in vitro studies and finally, when available, in vivo preclinical and clinical studies.},

abstract = {A new evaluation has been prepared of the independent & cumulative yields of the products of fission induced by thermal, fast, and 14 MeV neutrons in nuclides important for reactor design and operation and for fuel and waste management. Three spontaneously fissioning nuclides were also considered. The evaluation used a database that is considered to be complete up to early 1989. Careful study was made of experimental uncertainties and discrepancies, emphasizing the need for further measurements. Gaps in the data were filled by interpolation and extrapolation, using fits to empirical models. The yields were subsequently adjusted to fit physical constraints of the fissioning process. This paper describes the methods used in the evaluation, and includes graphs that illustrate the quality of the data. A computer library has been produced in ENDF/B-VI format giving yields from the neutron-induced fission of: 232Th, 233,234,235,236,238U, 237,238Np, 238,239,240,241,242Pu, 241,242m,243Am, and 243,244,245Cm, and from the spontaneous fission of 242,244Cm and 252Cf.

abstract = {Manganese is essential to life, and humans typically absorb sufficient quantities of this element from a normal healthy diet; however, chronic, elevated ingestion or inhalation of manganese can be neurotoxic, potentially leading to manganism. Although imaging of large amounts of accumulated Mn(II) is possible by MRI, quantitative measurement of the biodistribution of manganese, particularly at the trace level, can be challenging. In this study, we produced the positron-emitting radionuclide 52Mn (t1/2 = 5.6 d) by proton bombardment (Ep<15 MeV) of chromium metal, followed by solid-phase isolation by cation-exchange chromatography. An aqueous solution of [52Mn]MnCl2 was nebulized into a closed chamber with openings through which mice inhaled the aerosol, and a separate cohort of mice received intravenous (IV) injections of [52Mn]MnCl2. Ex vivo biodistribution was performed at 1 h and 1 d post-injection/inhalation (p.i.). In both trials, we observed uptake in lungs and thyroid at 1 d p.i. Manganese is known to cross the blood-brain barrier, as confirmed in our studies following IV injection (0.86%ID/g, 1 d p.i.) and following inhalation of aerosol, (0.31%ID/g, 1 d p.i.). Uptake in salivary gland and pancreas were observed at 1 d p.i. (0.5 and 0.8%ID/g), but to a much greater degree from IV injection (6.8 and 10%ID/g). In a separate study, mice received IV injection of an imaging dose of [52Mn]MnCl2, followed by in vivo imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo biodistribution. The results from this study supported many of the results from the biodistribution-only studies. In this work, we have confirmed results in the literature and contributed new results for the biodistribution of inhaled radiomanganese for several organs. Our results could serve as supporting information for environmental and occupational regulations, for designing PET studies utilizing 52Mn, and/or for predicting the biodistribution of manganese-based MR contrast agents.},

Today LANSCE continues operation as one of the most versatile accelerator-based user facilities in the world. During eight months of annual operation, scientists from around the world work at LANSCE to execute an extraordinarily broad program of defense and civilian research. Several areas operate simultaneously. The Lujan Neutron Scattering Center (Lujan Center) is a moderated spallation source (meV to keV), the Weapons Neutron Research Facility (WNR) is a bare spallation neutron source (keV to 800MeV), and a new ultra-cold neutron source will be operational in 2005. These sources give LANSCE the ability to produce and use neutrons with energies that range over 14 orders of magnitude. LANSCE also supplies beam to WNR and two other areas for applications requiring protons. In a proton radiography (pRad) area, a sequence of narrow proton pulses is transmitted through shocked materials and imaged to study dynamic properties. In 2005, LANSCE began operating a facility that uses 100-MeV protons to produce medical radioisotopes. To sustain a vigorous program beyond this decade, LANSCE has embarked on a project to refurbish key elements of the facility and to plan capabilities beyond those that presently exist.},

abstract = {A next-generation, high-flux DD neutron generator has been designed, commissioned, and characterized, and is now operational in a new facility at the University of California Berkeley. The generator, originally designed for 40Ar/39Ar dating of geological materials, has since served numerous additional applications, including medical isotope production studies, with others planned for the near future. In this work, we present an overview of the High Flux Neutron Generator (HFNG) which includes a variety of simulations, analytical models, and experimental validation of results. Extensive analysis was performed in order to characterize the neutron yield, flux, and energy distribution at specific locations where samples may be loaded for irradiation. A notable design feature of the HFNG is the possibility for sample irradiation internal to the cathode, just 8 mm away from the neutron production site, thus maximizing the neutron flux (n/cm2/s). The generator's maximum neutron flux at this irradiation position is 2.58e7 n/cm2/s +/- 5% (approximately 3e8 n/s total yield) as measured via activation of small natural indium foils. However, future development is aimed at achieving an order of magnitude increase in flux. Additionally, the deuterium ion beam optics were optimized by simulations for various extraction configurations in order to achieve a uniform neutron flux distribution and an acceptable heat load. Finally, experiments were performed in order to benchmark the modeling and characterization of the HFNG.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to image the extra domain B (ED-B) of fibronectin, an angiogenesis-related target, in solid tumors using small-animal PET. Toward this aim, an ED-B fibronectin-binding human antibody derivative (L19-SIP) was labeled with 76Br via an enzymatic approach. Biodistribution and imaging studies were performed in human teratoma–bearing mice for up to 48 h after injection. Methods: L19-SIP was labeled with 76Br using bromoperoxidase/H2O2. The stability of the labeled antibody was tested both in vitro and in vivo. Biodistribution and small-animal imaging studies (PET and CT) were performed in F9-bearing 129/sv mice (n = 3 or 4). Results: The enzymatic radiobromination approach afforded the labeled antibody in high yield (>55%) under mild reaction conditions. 76Br-L19-SIP stability in mouse serum proved to be similar to that of the 125I-labeled analog (>80% of intact material at 48 h after injection). Fast and specific in vivo targeting was obtained in tumors and other organs expressing ED-B fibronectin (i.e., ovaries and uterus). However, slow renal clearance and persistent activity predominately in blood and stomach suggests partial 76Br-L19-SIP debromination in vivo. This debromination was confirmed in a metabolism study in normal mice. The F9 tumors were clearly imaged by small-animal PET at each considered time point, starting at 5 h up to 48 h after injection. Conclusion: 76Br-L19-SIP specifically accumulated at the target site, enabling detailed small-animal PET of tumor neovasculature. Therefore, targeting the angiogenesis-associated expression of ED-B fibronectin can be a valuable tool for tumor detection using molecular imaging with PET.},

Independent measurement of the radiation flux indicates values of the ionization parameter $\xi$ $\sim$ 10 erg cm s -1 and Planckian radiation source of 80 eV to photoionize the nitrogen gas. The observed emission spectra of nitrogen of relatively low density ( n i = 1.4 × 10 19 cm −3 ) shows a good agreement with the synthetic spectra by a time-dependent DCA (Detailed Configuration Accounting) atomic model. In this model, it solves the rate equations for level population distributions by considering collisional and radiative atomic processes based on screened hydrogenic model. The jj configuration atomic states and transition probabilities are calculated with Hullac to synthesize spectrum. With this model, we can obtain a reasonable range of the electron temperatures of 20 — 30 eV. Comparisons of charge-state distribution with a non-LTE atomic model FLYCHK show reasonable agreement.},

abstract = {AbstractPurpose: We investigated the effect of incorporation of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) into a conjugate comprising the DNA binding ligand para-iodoHoechst (PIH) and octreotate on its DNA binding and affinity to the somatostatin receptor (SSTR). Confirmation of these properties would support development of similar conjugates labelled with Auger emitters for their potential in Auger endoradiotherapy. Materials and methods: We synthesized conjugates of PIH and octreotate (PO) or PIH and NLS (PN) and a conjugate comprising PIH, NLS and octreotate (PNO). DNA-binding characteristics of PIH and conjugates were assessed using synthetic DNA oligonucleotides employing spectrophotometric titration of ligand solutions with DNA. We used membranes from the type 2 SSTR (SSTR2) overexpressing human non-small cell lung cancer cell line A427-7 to investigate the binding affinity of PNO. Results: We demonstrated PN and PNO retain specific high affinity DNA-binding properties observed for PIH, and acquire an additional non-specific binding capacity. No DNA binding was observed for PO. PNO retains its binding affinity for SSTR. Conclusions: The DNA-binding properties of PNO and its affinity for SSTR suggests that it could potentially be used for tumour-specific delivery of PIH labelled with an Auger emitter in SSTR expressing tumours.},

abstract = {80mBr (half-life = 4.43 h) is an Auger electron emitting nuclide with convenient properties for investigating Auger electron cytotoxicity and with potential for labeling in vivo radiotherapeutic agents. We have investigated three cyclotron target systems capable of generating 80mBr of sufficiently high specific radioactivity (no carrier added) for biomedical experiments. A 83Kr gas target irradiated with 21.5 MeV deuterons made 80mBr at a production yield of 1.6 ± 0.2 mCi/$\mu$Ah at saturation. A five-fold increase in 80mBr yield was obtained from 15 MeV proton irradiation of thin elemental Se enriched in 80Se targets although technical improvements are expected to further raise this production yield. This route is therefore superior for current medical cyclotrons. Irradiation of a reusable 80Se copper selenide target also yielded multi-millicurie amounts of 80mBr, and recovery of radiobromine by dry distillation is faster and more convenient than in the elemental Se target, but an optimum copper selenide target for 80mBr production has not yet been built.},

abstract = {We present a hard X-ray spectrum of unprecedented quality of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) W49B obtained with the Suzaku satellite. The spectrum exhibits an unusual structure consisting of a saw-edged bump above 8 keV. This bump cannot be explained by any combination of high-temperature plasmas in ionization equilibrium. We firmly conclude that this bump is caused by the strong radiative recombination continuum (RRC) of iron, detected for the first time in a SNR. The electron temperature derived from the bremsstrahlung continuum shape and the slope of the RRC is $\sim$1.5 keV. On the other hand, the ionization temperature derived from the observed intensity ratios between the RRC and K$\alpha$ lines of iron is $\sim$2.7 keV. These results indicate that the plasma is in a highly overionized state. Volume emission measures independently determined from the fluxes of the thermal and RRC components are consistent with each other, suggesting the same origin of these components.},

abstract = {Abstract Cyclotrons are versatile ion-accelerating machines which find many applications in medicine. In this short review their use in hadron therapy is briefly discussed. Proton therapy is gaining significance because of its capability to treat deep-lying tumours. A strong area of application of cyclotrons involves the production of short-lived neutron deficient radiotracers for use in emission tomography, especially positron emission tomography. This fast and quantitative in vivo diagnostic technique is being increasingly used in neurology, cardiology and oncology. Besides routine patient care, considerable interdisciplinary work on development of new positron emitters is under way. A short account of those efforts is given. The use of cyclotrons in the production of radionuclides for internal radiotherapy is also briefly described.},

Resistance to irradiation damage is also very impressive, i.e. very small DBTT shift by irradiation and low swelling. Research and development of vanadium alloys have made a remarkable progress in recent years partly supported by ITER-related activities. Composition range centered about V4Cr4Ti is the target of many of the studies conducted in the US, Japan and RF. Most of the studies have demonstrated the superior performance of this alloy family, while some alloys containing large amount of impurities have shown relatively poor properties. In addition to the baseline mechanical properties, neutron irradiation effects, e.g., swelling and radiation embrittlement are covered in this paper. Of particular importance is the study of the effects of dynamically-charged helium on mechanical properties and swelling. Recent developments of insulator coatings and welding are also covered. The importance of mechanistic studies of the damage behavior is emphasized for efficient alloy development and prediction of materials life in service.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Emitting radionuclides such as 211At have a number of physical characteristics which make them attractive for the treatment of micrometastases. 211At was bound to polymer microspheres and its efficacy was compared with the $\beta$-emitting 32P and 90Y colloids for the treatment of intraperitoneally growing K13 hybridoma tumors in mice. Single graded doses of 0.1–2.5 MBq 211At microspheres injected intraperitoneally 24 hr after inoculation of the hybridoma cells improved survival and produced higher cure rates than 32P colloid, 90Y colloid, or no treatment. One of the most striking contrasts between 211At microspheres and 90Y or 32P colloids was the ability of relatively low doses 211At to affect cures. When comparing the groups with the highest survival rate for each radionuclide (0.1–1 MBq 211At, 2.5 MBq 90Y, and 2.5 MBq 32P), 211At treatment resulted in an improved survival over that with 32P therapy, but the difference was not significant between 211At and 90Y. Toxicity studies with 211At microspheres showed that dosages up to 17 MBq per mouse were not lethal. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the high-energy transfer and the short-range cytotoxicity of the $\alpha$-emitter 211At might be of benefit for intracavitary radiotherapy.},

@article{Voyles2018a,
abstract = {A stack of thin Nb foils was irradiated with the 100 MeV proton beam at Los Alamos National Laboratory's Isotope Production Facility, to investigate the $^{93}$Nb(p,4n)$^{90}$Mo nuclear reaction as a monitor for intermediate energy proton experiments and to benchmark state-of-the-art reaction model codes. A set of 38 measured cross sections for $^{\text{nat}}$Nb(p,x) and $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x) reactions between 40-90 MeV, as well as 5 independent measurements of isomer branching ratios, are reported. These are useful in medical and basic science radionuclide productions at intermediate energies. The $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x)$^{56}$Co, $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x)$^{62}$Zn, and $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x)$^{65}$Zn reactions were used to determine proton fluence, and all activities were quantified using HPGe spectrometry. Variance minimization techniques were employed to reduce systematic uncertainties in proton energy and fluence, improving the reliability of these measurements. The measured cross sections are shown to be in excellent agreement with literature values, and have been measured with improved precision compared with previous measurements. This work also reports the first measurement of the $^{\text{nat}}$Nb(p,x)$^{82\text{m}}$Rb reaction, and of the independent cross sections for $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x)$^{52\text{g}}$Mn and $^{\text{nat}}$Nb(p,x)$^{85\text{g}}$Y in the 40-90 MeV region. The effects of $^{\text{nat}}$Si(p,x)$^{22,24}$Na contamination, arising from silicone adhesive in the Kapton tape used to encapsulate the aluminum monitor foils, is also discussed as a cautionary note to future stacked-target cross section measurements. \emph{A priori} predictions of the reaction modeling codes CoH, EMPIRE, and TALYS are compared with experimentally measured values and used to explore the differences between codes for the $^{\text{nat}}$Nb(p,x) and $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x) reactions.},

abstract = {Although the general radiobiologic principles underlying external beam therapy and radionuclide therapy are the same, there are significant differences in the biophysical and radiobiologic effects from the two types of radiation. In addition to the emission of particulate radiation, targeted radionuclide therapy is characterized by (i) extended exposures and, usually, declining dose rates; (ii) nonuniformities in the distribution of radioactivity and, thus, absorbed dose; and (iii) particles of varying ionization density and, hence, quality. This chapter explores the special features that distinguish the biologic effects consequent to the traversal of charged particles through mammalian cells. It also highlights what has been learned when these radionuclides and radiotargeting pharmaceuticals are used to treat cancers.},

@article{Lit15,
abstract = {The nuclear fission process gives rise to the formation of fission fragments and emission of particles $ (n,\gamma , e^{-})$. The particle emission from fragments can be prompt and delayed. We present here the methods used in the FIFRELIN code, which simulates the prompt component of the de-excitation process. The methods are based on phenomenological models associated with macroscopic and/or microscopic ingredients. Input data can be provided by experiment as well as by theory. The fission fragment de-excitation can be performed within Weisskopf (uncoupled neutron and gamma emission) or a Hauser-Feshbach (coupled neutron/gamma emission) statistical theory. We usually consider five free parameters that cannot be provided by theory or experiments in order to describe the initial distributions required by the code. In a first step this set of parameters is chosen to reproduce a very limited set of target observables. In a second step we can increase the statistics to predict all other fission observables such as prompt neutron, gamma and conversion electron spectra but also their distributions as a function of any kind of parameters such as, for instance, the neutron, gamma and electron number distributions, the average prompt neutron multiplicity as a function of fission fragment mass, charge or kinetic energy, and so on. Several results related to different fissioning systems are presented in this work. The goal in the next decade will be i) to replace some macroscopic ingredients or phenomenological models by microscopic calculations when available and reliable, ii) to be a support for experimentalists in the design of detection systems or in the prediction of necessary beam time or count rates with associated statistics when measuring fragments and emitted particle in coincidence iii) extend the model to be able to run a calculation when no experimental input data are available, iv) account for multiple chance fission and gamma emission before fission, v) account for the scission neutrons. Several efforts have already been made to replace macroscopic ingredients and phenomenology by microscopic ingredients provided in various nuclear parameter libraries such as electric dipole photon strength functions or HFB level densities. First results relative to theses aspects are presented in this work.},

This work provides results for an energy region where no other data are available. These results, and values from the literature for energies above 13 MeV, are used to provide an estimation of the cross-section excitation function from ?4.2 to 20 MeV. An extrapolation of the cross section from 4.2 MeV to the effective threshold at ?3 MeV is derived from calculations based on a semiempirical model that is fitted to the experimental data at higher energies. This excitation function is used to compute fission-spectrum-average cross sections, which are compared with corresponding values from the literature.},

The useful areal density of activity is limited to about 150 mCi cm −2 for all matrices owing to resonance broadening, and the thickness of the source foil is determined by self absorption and the generation of fluorescence x rays. Electrostatic broadening and the change of isomer shift with age are shown to be relatively unimportant for sources of the above density of activity on chromium, rhodium and palladium. Rhodium is the best choice for a strong, unsplit source for use at 4{\textperiodcentered}2 K. Methods of preparation which give linewidths close to natural linewidths are discussed.},

The requirements for such data need to be addressed in a timely manner, and therefore an IAEA coordinated research project was launched in December 2012 to establish or improve the nuclear data required to characterise charged-particle monitor reactions. An international team was assembled to recommend more accurate cross-section data over a wide range of targets and projectiles, undertaken in conjunction with a limited number of measurements and more extensive evaluations of the decay data of specific radionuclides. Least-square evaluations of monitor-reaction cross sections including uncertainty quantification have been undertaken for charged-particle beams of protons, deuterons, 3He- and 4He-particles. Recommended beam monitor reaction data with their uncertainties are available at the IAEA-NDS medical portal www-nds.iaea.org/medical/monitor_reactions.html.},

abstract = {A set of global optical potentials for alpha particles with energies above 80 MeV has been extended to lower energies and proved appropriate to describe (n, cr) reactions. It is found that the transmission coefficients for alpha-particle emission are rather strongly related to the fusion cross sections and elastic scattering at energies above 80 MeV, but not to elastic scattering at lower energy where specific features are comprised within complex optical potential parametrizations. PACS number(s): 24. 10.Ht, 25.40.Hs, 25.55.Hp The n-nucleus interaction plays an important role in studies of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions. The concept of the a-particle mean field is now widely used to unify the bound and scattering alpha-particle states, just as the nuclear mean 6eld is used to calculate the proper-ties of bound single-particle states and also the scatter-ing of unbound nucleons by nuclei [1]. At positive ener-gies the alpha-particle mean 6eld is simply the familiar alpha-particle optical model potential, which describes very well the differential cross sections for the elastic scat-tering of alpha particles by nuclei. Unlike the nucleon case, there are however no global optical potentials for alpha particles that fit to good accuracy the scattering &om many nuclei over a wide range of energies. Some optical model analyses of low-energy data [2,3] favored a squared Woods-Saxon form factor, i.e. , a shape dif-ferent from that used for the nucleon-nucleus potential. However, a global optical potential has been obtained by Nolte et al. [4] for alpha particles with energies above 80 MeV, these data being similarly 6tted by using eithex a Woods-Saxon form factor or a squared Woods-Saxon form factor. In addition to this potential ambiguity, it has been found in heavy ion induced reactions that there is a sig-nificant reduction in the barrier for the evaporation of alpha particles &om nuclei excited to about 100 MeV and having large angular momenta [5,6]. Furthermore, the calculated alpha-particle emission probabilities from some fast-neutron induced reactions which give cross},

abstract = {Radiolabeled amino acids are superior PET tracers for the imaging of malignant tumors, and amino acids labeled with 76Br, an attractive positron emitter because of its relatively long half-life (16.2 h), could potentially be a widely usable tumor imaging tracer. In this study, in consideration of its stability and tumor specificity, we designed two 76Br-labeled amino acid derivatives, 2-76Br-bromo-$\alpha$-methyl-l-phenylalanine (2-76Br-BAMP) and 4-76Br-bromo-$\alpha$-methyl-l-phenylalanine (4-76Br-BAMP), and investigated their potential as tumor imaging agents. Methods: Both 76Br- and 77Br-labeled amino acid derivatives were prepared. We performed in vitro and in vivo stability studies and cellular uptake studies using the LS180 colon adenocarcinoma cell line. Biodistribution studies in normal mice and in LS180 tumor–bearing mice were performed, and the tumors were imaged with a small-animal PET scanner. Results: Both 77Br-BAMPs were stable in the plasma and in the murine body. Although both 77Br-BAMPs were taken up by LS180 cells and the uptake was inhibited by L-type amino acid transporter 1 inhibitors, 2-77Br-BAMP exhibited higher uptake than 4-77Br-BAMP. In the biodistribution studies, 2-77Br-BAMP showed more rapid blood clearance and lower renal accumulation than 4-77Br-BAMP. More than 90% of the injected radioactivity was excreted in the urine by 6 h after the injection of 2-77Br-BAMP. High tumor accumulation of 2-77Br-BAMP was observed in tumor-bearing mice, and PET imaging with 2-76Br-BAMP enabled clear visualization of the tumors. Conclusion: 2-77Br-BAMP exhibited preferred pharmacokinetics and high LS180 tumor accumulation, and 2-76Br-BAMP enabled clear visualization of the tumors by PET imaging. These findings suggest that 2-76Br-BAMP could constitute a potential new PET tracer for tumor imaging and may eventually enable the wider use of amino acid tracers.},

The overarching process design converts corn stover to ethanol by dilute-acid pretreatment, enzymatic saccharification, and co-fermentation. Building on design reports published in 2002 and 1999, NREL, together with the subcontractor Harris Group Inc., performed a complete review of the process design and economic model for the biomass-to-ethanol process. This update reflects NREL's current vision of the biochemical ethanol process and includes the latest research in the conversion areas (pretreatment, conditioning, saccharification, and fermentation), optimizations in product recovery, and our latest understanding of the ethanol plant's back end (wastewater and utilities). The conceptual design presented here reports ethanol production economics as determined by 2012 conversion targets and 'nth-plant' project costs and financing. For the biorefinery described here, processing 2,205 dry ton/day at 76% theoretical ethanol yield (79 gal/dry ton), the ethanol selling price is $2.15/gal in 2007$.},

abstract = {We describe the physics and data included in the Reference Input Parameter Library, which is devoted to input parameters needed in calculations of nuclear reactions and nuclear data evaluations. Advanced modelling codes require substantial numerical input, therefore the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has worked extensively since 1993 on a library of validated nuclear-model input parameters, referred to as the Reference Input Parameter Library (RIPL). A final RIPL coordinated research project (RIPL-3) was brought to a successful conclusion in December 2008, after 15 years of challenging work carried out through three consecutive IAEA projects. The RIPL-3 library was released in January 2009, and is available on the Web through http://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/. This work and the resulting database are extremely important to theoreticians involved in the development and use of nuclear reaction modelling (ALICE, EMPIRE, GNASH, UNF, TALYS) both for theoretical research and nuclear data evaluations. The numerical data and computer codes included in RIPL-3 are arranged in seven segments: MASSES contains ground-state properties of nuclei for about 9000 nuclei, including three theoretical predictions of masses and the evaluated experimental masses of Audi et al. (2003). DISCRETE LEVELS contains 117 datasets (one for each element) with all known level schemes, electromagnetic and $\gamma$-ray decay probabilities available from ENSDF in October 2007. NEUTRON RESONANCES contains average resonance parameters prepared on the basis of the evaluations performed by Ignatyuk and Mughabghab. OPTICAL MODEL contains 495 sets of phenomenological optical model parameters defined in a wide energy range. When there are insufficient experimental data, the evaluator has to resort to either global parameterizations or microscopic approaches. Radial density distributions to be used as input for microscopic calculations are stored in the MASSES segment. LEVEL DENSITIES contains phenomenological parameterizations based on the modified Fermi gas and superfluid models and microscopic calculations which are based on a realistic microscopic single-particle level scheme. Partial level densities formulae are also recommended. All tabulated total level densities are consistent with both the recommended average neutron resonance parameters and discrete levels. GAMMA contains parameters that quantify giant resonances, experimental gamma-ray strength functions and methods for calculating gamma emission in statistical model codes. The experimental GDR parameters are represented by Lorentzian fits to the photo-absorption cross sections for 102 nuclides ranging from 51V to 239Pu. FISSION includes global prescriptions for fission barriers and nuclear level densities at fission saddle points based on microscopic HFB calculations constrained by experimental fission cross sections.},

Coverage includes properties of adopted levels and $\gamma$ rays, decay-scheme data (energies, intensities and placement of radiations), and cross reference entries. The following tables continue the tradition of showing the systematic relationships between levels in A = 24. These assignments are based on energy differences for states with the same J$\pi$ values, $\gamma$-ray strengths, spectroscopic factors in analog single particle (T = 1) or two particle (T = 2) transfer reactions. Isospin is not a perfect quantum number and the adopted T-value may correspond to a small component in the wavefunction.},

abstract = {Cross sections for the 47Ti(n,p)47Sc and 64Zn(n,p)64Cu reactions have been measured for quasi-monoenergetic DD neutrons produced by the UC Berkeley High Flux Neutron Generator (HFNG). The HFNG is a compact neutron generator designed as a “flux-trap” that maximizes the probability that a neutron will interact with a sample loaded into a specific, central location. The study was motivated by interest in the production of 47Sc and 64Cu as emerging medical isotopes. The cross sections were measured in ratio to the 113In(n,n′)113mIn and 115In(n,n′)115mIn inelastic scattering reactions on co-irradiated indium samples. Post-irradiation counting using an HPGe and LEPS detectors allowed for cross section determination to within 5% uncertainty. The 64Zn(n,p)64Cu cross section for 2.76-0.02+0.01 MeV neutrons is reported as 49.3 ± 2.6 mb (relative to 113In) or 46.4 ± 1.7 mb (relative to 115In), and the 47Ti(n,p)47Sc cross section is reported as 26.26 ± 0.82 mb. The measured cross sections are found to be in good agreement with existing measured values but with lower uncertainty (<5%), and also in agreement with theoretical values. This work highlights the utility of compact, flux-trap DD-based neutron sources for nuclear data measurements and potentially the production of radionuclides for medical applications.},

Properties of colloid formation of 45TiOCl2 or 45TiO-phytate in vivo resulted in the highest radioactivity uptake in the rat liver, followed by the spleen, suggesting potential for imaging the reticuloendothelial system. Three 45TiO-complexes with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, citric acid and human serum albumin showed the highest radioactivity levels in the blood over 6 h. The binding of the 45Ti with plasma transferrin in vitro and Fouth International Symposium on Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry, J{\"{u}}lich, Germany, August 1982. in vivo suggested that these compounds can be used for estimating the blood volume. Also, potential as an indicator representing the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier in the rat was demonstrated by autoradiography.},

abstract = {Abstract Evaluated experimental data are presented for 13 known nuclides of mass 85 (Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo). Since the previous 1990 evaluation of A=85, 85Zn, 85Ga, 85Ge and 85nuclides are newly added here. Excited state data for 85Se, 85Zr have become available from radioactive decay and in–beam $\gamma$–ray studies. New and improved high–spin data are available for 85Br, 85Kr, 85Rb, 85Y, 85Nb and 85Mo. New direct and precise measurement of atomic masses of 85Ge, 85As, 85Se, 85Br, 85Rb, 85Zr, 85Nb and 85Mo have greatly improved the landscape of $\beta$ decay–Q values and separation energies in this mass region. In spite of extensive experimental work on the isobaric nuclei of this mass chain several deficiencies remain. No excited states are known in 85Zn, 85Ga, 85As. Only a few excited state are assigned in 85Ge from 85Ga $\beta$– decay. From radioactivity studies, the decay schemes of 85Zn and 85Mo are not known, and those for 85Ga, 85Ge, 85As and 10.9–s isomer of 85Zr are incomplete. Level lifetimes are not known for excited states in 85Se, 85Br, 85Nb and 85Mo. The 85Tc nuclide has not been detected in fragmentation experiments at GANIL, alluding to its unbound nature for proton emission. The 85Kr, 85Rb, 85Sr, and 85Y nuclides remain the most extensively studied from many different reactions and decays. The evaluation of A=85 nuclides has been done after a span of 23 years, thus includes an extensive amount of new data for almost each nuclide. This work supersedes the data for A=85 nuclides presented in earlier full NDS publication by J. Tepel in 1980Te04 and a later one published in an update mode by H. Sievers in 1991Si01},

abstract = {Control over the nucleation of new phases is highly desirable but elusive. Even though there is a long history of crystallization engineering by varying physicochemical parameters, controlling which polymorph crystallizes or whether a molecule crystallizes or forms an amorphous precipitate is still a poorly understood practice. Although there are now numerous examples of control using laser-induced nucleation, the absence of physical understanding is preventing progress. Here we show that the proximity of a liquid–liquid critical point or the corresponding binodal line can be used by a laser-tweezing potential to induce concentration gradients. A simple theoretical model shows that the stored electromagnetic energy of the laser beam produces a free-energy potential that forces phase separation or triggers the nucleation of a new phase. Experiments in a liquid mixture using a low-power laser diode confirm the effect. Phase separation and nucleation using a laser-tweezing potential explains the physics behind non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation and suggests new ways of manipulating matter.},

The radioactivity of the activation products was determined by high resolution -ray spectroscopy. Statistical model calculations taking into account the precompound effects were performed for all the reactions, using a consistent set of model parameters. The experimental excitation functions of the proton and alpha-particle induced reactions are described within 10 to 15 percent by the calculation over the whole investigated energy range. The shapes of the excitation functions of the deuteron induced reactions are also reproduced well by the model calculation. However, a reduction factor (R=0.56) is needed to take account of the direct breakup process and, thereby, to obtain good agreement between the experimental data and model calculations. {\textcopyright} 1994 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Srivastava2012,
abstract = {This article reintroduces and reinforces our proposed paradigm that involves specific individual “dual-purpose” radionuclides or radionuclide pairs with emissions suitable for both imaging and therapy and which, when molecularly (selectively) targeted using appropriate carriers, would allow pretherapy low-dose imaging as well as higher-dose therapy in the same patient. We have made an attempt to sort out and organize a number of such theragnostic radionuclides and radionuclide pairs that may thus potentially bring us closer to the age-long dream of personalized medicine for performing tailored low-dose molecular imaging (single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography or positron emission tomography/CT) to provide the necessary pretherapy information on biodistribution, dosimetry, the limiting or critical organ or tissue, the maximum tolerated dose, and so forth, followed by performing higher-dose targeted molecular therapy in the same patient with the same radiopharmaceutical. Beginning in the 1980s, our work at Brookhaven National Laboratory with such a “dual-purpose” radionuclide, tin-117m, convinced us that it is arguably one of the most promising theragnostic radionuclides, and we have continued to concentrate on this effort. Our results with this radionuclide are therefore covered in somewhat greater detail in this publication. A major problem that continues to be addressed, but remains yet to be fully resolved, is the lack of availability, in sufficient quantities, of a majority of the best candidate theragnostic radionuclides in a no-carrier-added form. A brief description of the recently developed new or modified methods at Brookhaven National Laboratory for the production of 5 theragnostic radionuclide/radionuclide pair items, whose nuclear, physical, and chemical characteristics seem to show great promise for personalized cancer and other therapies, is provided.},

abstract = {Abstract Proton beam energy, energy straggling, and intensity in thick stacks of target materials at the Los Alamos Isotope Production Facility were investigated using the foil activation technique and computational simulations. Isotopic yield measurements of irradiated foils from several recent experiments used to determine these quantities were compared with the predictions of MCNP6 and TRIM codes, and with Andersen & Ziegler's semi-empirical formalism. Differences between code predictions and experimental data were examined. Methods for computational simulation of energy propagation agree well with one another and were able to accurately predict the proton beam's energy for a limited range. Predictions were accurate when degrading from an initial energy of 100 MeV down to approximately 50 MeV, but struggled to represent measured data well at lower energies.},

abstract = {This paper presents a general overview of nuclear data evaluation and its applications as developed at NRG, Petten. Based on concepts such as robustness, reproducibility and automation, modern calculation tools are exploited to produce original nuclear data libraries that meet the current demands on quality and completeness. This requires a system which comprises differential measurements, theory development, nuclear model codes, resonance analysis, evaluation, ENDF formatting, data processing and integral validation in one integrated approach. Software, built around the TALYS code, will be presented in which all these essential nuclear data components are seamlessly integrated. Besides the quality of the basic data and its extensive format testing, a second goal lies in the diversity of processing for different type of users. The implications of this scheme are unprecedented. The most important are:. 1. Complete ENDF-6 nuclear data files, in the form of the TENDL library, including covariance matrices, for many isotopes, particles, energies, reaction channels and derived quantities. All isotopic data files are mutually consistent and are supposed to rival those of the major world libraries.2. More exact uncertainty propagation from basic nuclear physics to applied (reactor) calculations based on a Monte Carlo approach: "Total" Monte Carlo (TMC), using random nuclear data libraries.3. Automatic optimization in the form of systematic feedback from integral measurements back to the basic data. This method of work also opens a new way of approaching the analysis of nuclear applications, with consequences in both applied nuclear physics and safety of nuclear installations, and several examples are given here. This applied experience and feedback is integrated in a final step to improve the quality of the nuclear data, to change the users vision and finally to orchestrate their integration into simulation codes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {For many years, laser-driven ion acceleration, mainly proton acceleration, has been proposed and a number of proof-of-principle experiments have been carried out with lasers whose pulse duration was in the nanosecond range. In the 1990s, ion acceleration in a relativistic plasma was demonstrated with ultra-short pulse lasers based on the chirped pulse amplification technique which can provide not only picosecond or femtosecond laser pulse duration, but simultaneously ultra-high peak power of terawatt to petawatt levels. Starting from the year 2000, several groups demonstrated low transverse emittance, tens of MeV proton beams with a conversion efficiency of up to several percent. The laser-accelerated particle beams have a duration of the order of a few picoseconds at the source, an ultra-high peak current and a broad energy spectrum, which make them suitable for many, including several unique, applications. This paper reviews, firstly, the historical background including the early laser–matter interaction studies on energetic ion acceleration relevant to inertial confinement fusion. Secondly, we describe several implemented and proposed mechanisms of proton and/or ion acceleration driven by ultra-short high-intensity lasers. We pay special attention to relatively simple models of several acceleration regimes. The models connect the laser, plasma and proton/ion beam parameters, predicting important features, such as energy spectral shape, optimum conditions and scalings under these conditions for maximum ion energy, conversion efficiency, etc. The models also suggest possible ways to manipulate the proton/ion beams by tailoring the target and irradiation conditions. Thirdly, we review experimental results on proton/ion acceleration, starting with the description of driving lasers. We list experimental results and show general trends of parameter dependences and compare them with the theoretical predictions and simulations. The fourth topic includes a review of scientific, industrial and medical applications of laser-driven proton or ion sources, some of which have already been established, while the others are yet to be demonstrated. In most applications, the laser-driven ion sources are complementary to the conventional accelerators, exhibiting significantly different properties. Finally, we summarize the paper.},

The optimum energy range for the production of both 61Cu and 64Cu was found to be 12 → 9 MeV. The calculated thick target yield of 61Cu amounts to 17.5 mCi (647 MBq)/$\gamma$Ah. At the given enrichment the yield was 15.5 mCi (573 MBq)/$\gamma$Ah and the expected level of 60Cu and 64Cu impurities at EOB reached 14.59 and 0.086%, respectively. For production of 64Cu the yield was 6.71 mCi (248 MBq)/$\gamma$Ah. At 95% enrichment of the target material the 64Cu yield amounts to 6.38 mCi (236 MBq)/$\gamma$Ah and the 60Cu and 61Cu impurities at EOB are 10.01 and 0.41%, respectively. An anion-exchange chromatographic technique for the separation of radiocopper from activated Ni target was developed. The 61Ni(p,n)61Cu and 64Ni(p,n)64Cu processes are suited for the production of 61Cu and 64Cu at a small cyclotron. The common production routes for 64Cu are briefly reviewed.},

The new cross-sections were compared to literature data. The optimum energy range for production of 64Cu was found to be 70→35MeV on 66Zn and 37→20MeV on 68Zn. The thick-target yields were determined as 777MBq/$\mu$Ah (21.0mCi/$\mu$Ah) and 185MBq/$\mu$Ah (5.0mCi/$\mu$Ah), respectively. The yields of the longer-lived contaminant copper radioisotopes (i.e. 61Cu when using 66Zn as target material and both 61Cu and 67Cu in the case of 68Zn target material) were also calculated. The results obtained from the present study indicate that both reactions are suited for the production of 64Cu at a medium energy cyclotron. The optimum energy ranges are also complementary therefore the potential to utilize tandem targetry exists.},

abstract = {We present new phenomenological optical model potentials (OMPs) for neutrons and protons with incident energies from 1 keV up to 200 MeV, for (near-)spherical nuclides in the mass range 24 ≤ A ≤ 209. They are based on a smooth, unique functional form for the energy dependence of the potential depths, and on physically constrained geometry parameters. For the first time, this enables one to predict basic scattering observables over a broad mass range and over an energy range that covers several orders of magnitude in MeV. Thereby, the necessity of using different OMPs in different energy regions has been removed. Using extensive grid searches and a new computational steering technique, we have obtained optical model parameters for many isotopes separately. We recommend that the resulting, so-called local, optical models be used in theoretical analyses of nuclear data. From these parameterizations, we have also constructed asymmetry-dependent neutron and proton global OMPs that are superior to all other existing phenomenological ones, not only with respect to the description of observables, but also as they cover larger mass and energy ranges. These (nucleon) global OMPs, we believe, may be used with some confidence in other studies whenever one of our local OMPs does not exist. To constrain our parameterization as much as possible and to assess the performance of our OMPs, we have compared our calculated results with an extensive experimental data set. This data set includes average resonance parameters, total and non-elastic cross sections, elastic scattering angular distributions and analyzing powers. The numerous local OMPs we have obtained allow us to disentangle asymmetry, Coulomb correction and mass-dependent components of our global OMPs. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Purpose: Radiochromic film provides dose measurement at high spatial resolution, but often is not preferred for routine evaluation of patient?specific intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans owing to ease?of?use factors. The authors have established an efficient protocol that combines calibration and measurement in a single scan and enables measurement results to be obtained in less than 30 min. This avoids complications due to postexposure changes in radiochromic film that delay the completion of a measurement, often for up to 24 h, in commonly used methods. In addition, the protocol addresses the accuracy and integrity of the measurement by eliminating environmental and interscan variability issues. Methods: The authors collected dose?response data from six production lots of Gafchromic EBT3 film and three production lots of EBT2 film at doses up to 480 cGy. In this work, the authors used seven different scanners of two different models?Epson 10000XL and V700; postexposure times before scanning from 30 min to 9 days; ambient temperatures for scanning spanning 11?°C; and two film orientations. Scanning was in 48?bit RGB format at 72 dpi resolution. Dose evaluation was conducted using a triple?channel dosimetry method. To evaluate the measurement protocol, patient specific IMRT and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were exposed onto EBT3 films on a Varian Trilogy Linac. Film scanning was done following the protocol under a number of different conditions and the dose maps were analyzed to demonstrate the equivalence of results. Results: The results indicated that the dose?response data could be fit by a set of related rational functions leading to the description of a generic calibration curve. A simplified dosimetry protocol was established where dose?response data for a specific film lot, scanner, and scanning conditions could be derived from two films exposed to known doses. In most cases only one calibrated exposure was required since the dose for one of the films could be zero. Using the Gamma test criterion of 2%/2 mm to evaluate the measurements, similar passing rates ranging between about 95% and 99% for the fields studied were obtained from application films digitized under a variety of conditions all of them different than the conditions under which the calibration films were scanned. Conclusions: The authors have developed a simplified and efficient protocol to measure doses delivered by an IMRT or VMAT plan using only the patient film, one calibration film, one unexposed film, and applying a single scan to acquire a digital image for calculation and analysis. The simplification and timesaving offer a potential practical solution for using radiochromic film for routine treatment plan quality assurance without sacrificing spatial resolution for convenience.},

abstract = {Abstract Niobium is a metal with important technological applications: use as alloying element to increase strength of super alloys, as thin layer for tribological applications, as superconductive material, in high temperature engineering systems, etc. In the frame of a systematic study of activation cross-sections of charged particle induced reactions on structural materials proton induced excitation functions on Nb targets were determined with the aim of applications in accelerator and reactor technology and for thin layer activation (TLA). The charged particle activation cross-sections on this element are also important for yield calculation of medical isotope production (88,89Zr, 86,87,88Y) and for dose estimation in PET targetry. As niobium is a monoisotopic element it is an ideal target material to test nuclear reaction theories. We present here the experimental excitation functions of 93Nb(p,x)90,93mMo, 92m,91m,90Nb, 88,89Zr and 88Y in the energy range 0–37MeV. The results were compared with the theoretical cross-sections calculated by means of the code ALICE-IPPE, EMPIRE-3, TALYS and with the literature data. The theory reproduces the shape of the measured results well and magnitude is also acceptable. Thick target yields calculated from our fitted cross-section give reliable estimations for production of medically relevant radioisotopes and for dose estimation in accelerator technology.},

abstract = {AbstractBackground and purpose To improve precision of particle therapy, in vivo range verification is highly desirable. Methods based on prompt gamma rays emitted during treatment seem promising but have not yet been applied clinically. Here we report on the worldwide first clinical application of prompt gamma imaging (PGI) based range verification. Material and methods A prototype of a knife-edge shaped slit camera was used to measure the prompt gamma ray depth distribution during a proton treatment of a head and neck tumor for seven consecutive fractions. Inter-fractional variations of the prompt gamma profile were evaluated. For three fractions, in-room control {CTs} were acquired and evaluated for dose relevant changes. Results The measurement of {PGI} profiles during proton treatment was successful. Based on the {PGI} information, inter-fractional global range variations were in the range of ±2 mm for all evaluated fractions. This is in agreement with the control {CT} evaluation showing negligible range variations of about 1.5 mm. Conclusions For the first time, range verification based on prompt gamma imaging was applied for a clinical proton treatment. With the translation from basic physics experiments into clinical operation, the potential to improve the precision of particle therapy with this technique has increased considerably.},

abstract = {This work reports an investigation on mass transfer by ultrasound agitation during electrodeposition on electrodes separated by a narrow inter-electrode gap. Polarisation experiments were performed to identify the mass transfer limiting current. The limiting current density was used to calculate mass transfer boundary layer thicknesses which were used to develop mass transfer correlations. Experiments were carried out using a cell with parallel copper discs which were positioned at gaps of 1, 0.5 and 0.15cm. The distance between the ultrasonic probe and electrodes was varied between 3 and 1.5cm. The polarisation data showed clear limiting current plateaux when the distance between the electrodes was larger, however significant distortions were observed when the gap was 0.15cm. It was found that lower ultrasound powers of 9-18W/cm2provided more effective agitation at narrower electrode gaps than powers exceeding 18W/cm2. Sherwood correlations showed that in this system, developing turbulence occurs for larger inter-electrode spacing, whereas for narrow electrode gaps fully turbulent correlations were obtained. A 2-D current distribution model showed that potential distortions that were observed in the polarisation data were caused by the close placement of the metallic US probe to the two parallel electrodes. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Purpose: A new method to evaluate radiochromic film dosimetry data scanned in multiple color channels is presented. This work was undertaken to demonstrate that the multichannel method is fundamentally superior to the traditional single channel method. The multichannel method allows for the separation and removal of the nondose?dependent portions of a film image leaving a residual image that is dependent only on absorbed dose. Methods: Radiochromic films were exposed to 10???10 cm radiation fields (Co?60 and 6 MV) at doses up to about 300 cGy. The films were scanned in red?blue?green (RGB) format on a flatbed color scanner and measured to build calibration tables relating the absorbed dose to the response of the film in each of the color channels. Film images were converted to dose maps using two methods. The first method used the response from a single color channel and the second method used the response from all three color channels. The multichannel method allows for the separation of the scanned signal into one part that is dose?dependent and another part that is dose?independent and enables the correction of a variety of disturbances in the digitized image including nonuniformities in the active coating on the radiochromic film as well as scanner related artifacts. The fundamental mathematics of the two methods is described and the dose maps calculated from film images using the two methods are compared and analyzed. Results: The multichannel dosimetry method was shown to be an effective way to separate out nondose?dependent abnormalities from radiochromic dosimetry film images. The process was shown to remove disturbances in the scanned images caused by nonhomogeneity of the radiochromic film and artifacts caused by the scanner and to improve the integrity of the dose information. Multichannel dosimetry also reduces random noise in the dose images and mitigates scanner?related artifacts such as lateral position dependence. In providing an ability to calculate dose maps from data in all the color channels the multichannel method provides the ability to examine the agreement between the color channels. Furthermore, when using calibration data to convert RGB film images to dose using the new method, poor correspondence between the dose calculations for the three color channels provides an important indication that the this new technique enables easy indication in case the dose and calibration films are curve mismatched. The method permit compensation for thickness nonuniformities in the film, increases the signal to noise level, mitigates the lateral dose?dependency of flatbed scanners effect of the calculated dose map and extends the evaluable dose range to 10 cGy?100 Gy. Conclusions: Multichannel dosimetry with radiochromic film like Gafchromic? EBT2 is shown to have significant advantages over single channel dosimetry. It is recommended that the dosimetry protocols described be implemented when using this radiochromic film to ensure the best data integrity and dosimetric accuracy.},

These populations are then used in the calculation of $\gamma$-ray emission rates to obtain the corresponding delayed $\gamma$-ray spectra. FIER output was compared to experimental data obtained by irradiation of a 235U sample in the Godiva critical assembly. This investigation illuminated discrepancies in the input nuclear data libraries, showcasing the usefulness of FIER as a tool to address nuclear data deficiencies through comparison with experimental data.

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive imaging technique that provides a functional or metabolic assessment of normal tissue or disease conditions. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging (FDG-PET) is widely used clinically for tumor imaging due to increased glucose metabolism in most types of tumors, and has been shown to improve the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of cancers. In this chapter, we review its use in cancer diagnosis, staging, restaging, and assessment of response to treatment. In addition, other metabolic PET imaging agents in research or clinical trial stages are discussed, including amino acid analogs based on increased protein synthesis, and choline, which is based on increased membrane lipid synthesis. Amino acid analogs and choline are more specific to tumor cells than FDG, so they play an important role in differentiating cancers from benign conditions and in the diagnosis of cancers with low FDG uptake or high background FDG uptake. For decades, researchers have shown that tumors have altered metabolic profiles and display elevated uptake of glucose, amino acids, and lipids, which can be used for cancer diagnosis and monitoring of the therapeutic response with excellent signal-to-noise ratios. },

Excited-state data are nonexistent for 61Sc, 61Ti, 61V, and 61Ge. Significant amounts of new data have been added since the previous \{NDS\} evaluation of A=61 nuclides (1999Bh04). 61Sc nuclide is now experimentally known, but without any knowledge of its half-life. The ground state half-lives of 61Ti and 61V are now determined. Excited-state data have become available for 61Cr, 61Mn and 61Ga, while for 61Ge, five excited states were erroneously assigned in the previous evaluation, these have been omitted here. Improved and extensive high-spin excitations are available for 61Fe, 61Cu and 61Zn, including several new superdeformed structures in 61Cu and 61Zn. Thermal neutron capture $\gamma$-ray data are available in detail from 2004Ra23. The radioactive decay schemes of 61Sc and 61Ti are not known, while those for 61V, 61Fe and 61Ge are poorly known. This work benefited from the earlier full evaluations of A=61 published by 1999Bh04, 1983Ek01 and 1975Au05 and the one published in an ‘update' mode by 1992Zh31.

abstract = {In the density matrix formalism, the ensemble of atoms or ions is expressed in terms of population and alignment of excited levels and the ground state. The population of an excited level determines the intensity of an emission line originating from this level and the alignment gives rise to the linear polarization of this line. Spatially anisotropic collisions induce transitions between the populations and the alignments; for example, an alignment along with a population is produced by a beam of electrons in an excited level from the ground-state population. Thus, an anisotropic plasma produces polarized radiations, and by plasma polarization spectroscopy (PPS) we can investigate the anisotropic, and thus non-thermal, features of the plasma. The angular distribution of the perturber velocities is expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials. The expansion coefficients and the relevant cross sections for the transitions among the populations and the alignments yield the rate coefficients for these transitions. For the ensemble of atoms or ions immersed in the plasma, coupled rate equations are constructed for the populations and the alignments of excited levels. We review the present status of our knowledge of the collision cross sections for various collision processes. Several experimental observations of PPS performed so far are reviewed, which include those on a tokamak plasma, laser produced plasmas, various discharge plasmas and solar flares. We discuss what kind of information could be obtained from PPS.},

In a series of irradiation experiments at the cyclotron of the Svedberg Laboratory/University of Uppsala sixteen different target elements were investigated for proton energies up to 100 MeV in order to determine such thin-target excitation functions. Residual nuclides were measured by gamma-spectrometry and, in the case of10Be and26Al, by accelerator mass spectrometry. Here, we report results for the light target elements C, N, O, Mg, Al, and Si including also new cross sections for the production of10Be and26Al from aluminum for p-energies between 100 MeV and 200 MeV. The latter were derived from targets irradiated earlier at the IPN Orsay. The new experimental data are compared with earlier work and analyzed in the framework of the hybrid model of preequilibrium reactions investigating several options with respect to the choice of nuclear masses including also corrections for shell effects of nuclear masses and level densities.},

abstract = { ▪ Abstract The size and frequency of meals are fundamental aspects of nutrition that can have profound effects on the health and longevity of laboratory animals. In humans, excessive energy intake is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers and is a major cause of disability and death in industrialized countries. On the other hand, the influence of meal frequency on human health and longevity is unclear. Both caloric (energy) restriction (CR) and reduced meal frequency/intermittent fasting can suppress the development of various diseases and can increase life span in rodents by mechanisms involving reduced oxidative damage and increased stress resistance. Many of the beneficial effects of CR and fasting appear to be mediated by the nervous system. For example, intermittent fasting results in increased production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which increases the resistance of neurons in the brain to dysfunction and degeneration in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders; BDNF signaling may also mediate beneficial effects of intermittent fasting on glucose regulation and cardiovascular function. A better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms by which meal size and frequency affect human health may lead to novel approaches for disease prevention and treatment. },

Bush in late 2002, is chartered to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks. The Commission is also mandated to provide recommendations designed to guard against future attacks. On July 22, 2004 the Commission released its public report, which is available for download from this site. The report is also available in bookstores nationwide and from the Government Printing Office. On August 21, 2004 the Commission released two staff monographs, available for download along with other staff statements on this site. The ten members of the 9-11 Commission announce the creation of the 9/11 Public Discourse Project. The Commission closed on August 21, 2004.},

The data have been compared with calculations based upon the statistical compound model of nuclear reactions. For nuclei which are not deformed, one can predict the correct shapes of the cross-section curves from a few keV up to the energy at which the target levels are known. Predicting the absolute values depends sensitively upon the choice of $\Lambda$$\gamma$/Dobs, for which parameter accurate values are not always available. For the deformed nuclei, statistical theory in combination with the spherical optical model does not correctly predict the shapes.},

The approach presented in this paper, known as the GEAR-MC method, allows for the calculation of generalized sensitivity coefficients for multiple responses in a single Monte Carlo calculation with no nuclear data perturbations or knowledge of nuclear covariance data. The theory behind the GEAR-MC method is presented here, and proof of principle is demonstrated by using the GEAR-MC method to calculate sensitivity coefficients for responses in several 3D, continuous-energy Monte Carlo applications.},

In connection with production of 64Cu, excitation functions of the reactions natZn(d,x)64Cu, 66Zn(d,$\alpha$)64Cu and 68Zn(p,$\alpha$n)64Cu were measured radiochemically using the stacked-foil technique. From the measured data, the thick target yields of 64Cu were calculated and compared with experimental data available in the literature. The three investigated processes are discussed in comparison to the commonly used 64Ni(p,n)64Cu reaction for the production of 64Cu. As regards 67Cu production, the technical feasibility of the 70Zn(p,$\alpha$)67Cu process was investigated. An electroplated isotopically enriched 70Zn target was developed which can withstand slanting beams of 20MeV protons of currents up to 20$\mu$A. Methods for chemical separation of 67Cu and efficient recovery of the enriched target material were worked out. The method is suitable only for small-scale production of 67Cu.},

Bacteria that adhere to implanted medical devices or damaged tissue can encase themselves in a hydrated matrix of polysaccharide and protein, and form a slimy layer known as a biofilm. Antibiotic resistance of bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth contributes to the chronicity of infections such as those associated with implanted medical devices. The mechanisms of resistance in biofilms are different from the now familiar plasmids, transposons, and mutations that confer innate resistance to individual bacterial cells. In biofilms, resistance seems to depend on multicellular strategies. We summarise the features of biofilm infections, review emerging mechanisms of resistance, and discuss potential therapies.},

abstract = {In vitro and in vivo studies in human glioma models suggest that the antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 labeled with the 7.2-h–half-life $\alpha$-particle emitter 211At might be a valuable endoradiotherapeutic agent for the treatment of brain tumors. The purpose of this study was to develop methods for the production of high levels of 211At and the radiosynthesis of clinically useful amounts of 211At-labeled human/mouse chimeric 81C6 antibody. Methods: 211At was produced through the 209Bi($\alpha$, 2n)211At reaction using an internal target system and purified by a dry distillation process. Antibody labeling was accomplished by first synthesizing N-succinimidyl 3-[211At]astatobenzoate from the corresponding tri-n-butyl tin precursor and reacting it with the antibody in pH 8.5 borate buffer. Quality control procedures consisted of methanol precipitation, size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and pyrogen and sterility assays, as well as determination of the immunoreactive fraction by a rapid procedure using a recombinant tenascin fragment coupled to magnetic beads. Results: A total of 16 antibody labeling runs were performed. Using beam currents of 50–60 $\mu$A $\alpha$-particles and irradiation times of 1.5–4.5 h, the mean 211At production yield was 27.75 ± 2.59 MBq/$\mu$A.h, and the maximum level of 211At produced was 6.59 GBq after a 4-h irradiation at 55 $\mu$A. The decay-corrected distillation yield was 67% ± 16%. The yield for the coupling of the 211At-labeled active ester to the antibody was 76% ± 8%. The fraction of 211At activity that eluted with a retention time corresponding to intact IgG on HPLC was 96.0% ± 2.5%. All preparations had a pyrogen level of <0.125 EU/mL and were determined to be sterile. The mean immunoreactive fraction for these 16 preparations was 83.3% ± 5.3%. Radiolysis did not interfere with labeling chemistry or the quality of the labeled antibody product. Conclusion: These results show that it is feasible to produce clinically relevant activities of 211At-labeled antibodies and have permitted the initiation of a phase I trial of 211At-labeled chimeric 81C6 administered directly into the tumor resection cavities of brain tumor patients.},

abstract = {Transgenic plants are promising alternatives for the low-cost and safe pathogen-free production of complex recombinant pharmaceutical proteins (molecular farming). Plants as higher eukaryotes perform posttranslational modifications similar to those of mammalian cells. However, plant-specific protein N -glycosylation was shown to be immunogenic, a fact that represents a drawback for many plant systems in biopharmaceutical production. The moss Physcomitrella patens offers unique properties as a contained system for protein production. It is grown in the predominant haploid gametophytic stage as tissue suspension cultures in photobioreactors. Efficient secretory signals and a transient transfection system allow the secretion of freshly synthesized proteins to the surrounding medium. The key advantage of Physcomitrella compared to other plant systems is the feasibility of targeted gene replacements. By this means, moss strains with non-immunogenic humanized glycan patterns were created. Here we present an overview of the relevant aspects for establishing moss as a production system for recombinant biopharmaceuticals.},

In vitro binding of 76Br-A33 to SW1222 colonic cancer cells showed that the immunoreactivity was retained.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Little is known of the biochemistry of diatoms, although many workers have reported growth experiments with the unicellular algae of the marine phyto-plankton. Experiments have often been performed without due regard for the appropriate control of physical and chemical conditions. Many reports contain only incomplete data of the growth under a given set of conditions, and it is often impossible to say whether the effects recorded are upon the growth rate, the total crop, or both. Other studies have been reported which included the addition of organic matter to cultures which were only uni-algal and not bacteria-free. At the present time even the mere maintenance of stock cultures of the marine unicellular algae is perforce an empirical matter. Results in replicate cultures often show gross differences in growth that are apparent on inspection by eye alone, and insufficient information is available regarding the nature of these variations in growth to allow the rational development of improved culture media. Due therefore to a lack of suitable techniques, most of the results available are difficult, if not impossible, to interpret in terms of the biochemical activities of the algae.},

abstract = {It is almost 80 years since Hans Bethe described the level density as a non-interacting gas of protons and neutrons. In all these years, experimental data were interpreted within this picture of a fermionic gas. However, the renewed interest of measuring level density using various techniques calls for a revision of this description. In particular, the wealth of nuclear level densities measured with the Oslo method favors the constant-temperature level density over the Fermi-gas picture. From the basis of experimental data, we demonstrate that nuclei exhibit a constant-temperature level density behavior for all mass regions and at least up to the neutron threshold.},

Spending on advanced imaging, such as CT scans, MRIs, and nuclear medicine, rose substantially faster than other imaging services such as ultrasound, X-ray, and other standard imaging. GAO's analysis of the 6-year period showed certain trends linking spending growth to the provision of imaging services in physician offices. The proportion of Medicare spending on imaging services performed in-office rose from 58 percent to 64 percent. Physicians also obtained an increasing share of their Medicare revenue from imaging services. In addition, in-office imaging spending per beneficiary varied substantially across geographic regions of the country, suggesting that not all utilization was necessary or appropriate. By 2006, in-office imaging spending per beneficiary varied almost eight-fold across the states—from $62 in Vermont to $472 in Florida.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to establish a three-dimensional (3-D) in vitro model system of cardiac muscle for electrophysiological studies. Primary neonatal rat ventricular cells containing lower or higher fractions of cardiac myocytes were cultured on polymeric scaffolds in bioreactors to form regular or enriched cardiac muscle constructs, respectively. After 1 wk, all constructs contained a peripheral tissue-like region (50-70 {micro}m thick) in which differentiated cardiac myocytes were organized in multiple layers in a 3-D configuration. Indexes of cell size (protein/DNA) and metabolic activity (tetrazolium conversion/DNA) were similar for constructs and neonatal rat ventricles. Electrophysiological studies conducted using a linear array of extracellular electrodes showed that the peripheral region of constructs exhibited relatively homogeneous electrical properties and sustained macroscopically continuous impulse propagation on a centimeter-size scale. Electrophysiological properties of enriched constructs were superior to those of regular constructs but inferior to those of native ventricles. These results demonstrate that 3-D cardiac muscle constructs can be engineered with cardiac-specific structural and electrophysiological properties and used for in vitro impulse propagation studies.},

abstract = {The radiochemical separation of 88Y from proton irradiated natSrCO3 and alpha-particle irradiated natRbCl, of 86Y from proton irradiated 86SrCO3, and of 87Y from alpha-particle irradiated natRbCl were studied at no-carrier-added levels by two techniques, namely, ion-exchange chromatography using Dowex 50W-X8 and Dowex 21K resins, and solvent extraction using HDEHP. Out of all those methods, the ion-exchange chromatography using Dowex 50W-X8 (cation-exchanger) was found to be the best: the separation yield was high, the chemical impurity in the separated radioyttrium (inactive Sr or Rb) was low (0.5 $\mu$g) and the final product was obtained in the form of citrate. The optimized separation method using Dowex 50W-X8 was applied in practical production of 86Y and 88Y via proton irradiations of 86SrCO3 and natSrCO3, respectively, at 16 MeV as well as of 87Y and 88Y via $\alpha$-particle irradiation of natRbCl at 26 MeV. The tangible experimental yields of 86Y and 87Y amounted to 150 and 5.7 MBq/$\mu$A{\textperiodcentered}h, respectively. The yields of 88Y obtained were 0.06 MBq/$\mu$A{\textperiodcentered}h and 1 MBq/$\mu$A{\textperiodcentered}h for alpha-particle and proton irradiations, respectively. Each yield value corresponds to more than 70{\%} of the respective theoretical value.},

@article{Fassbender1997,
abstract = {Abstract Excitation functions of (p,x) processes on collimator materials for radiation therapy (Cu, Zn and brass), leading to the formation of long-lived activation products, were measured over the proton energy range 70 to 350 MeV using the stacked-foil technique. In most of the cases the product activity could be measured non-destructively via $\gamma$-ray spectrometry; for studies on low-yield products, however, radiochemical separations were essential. A comparison of the data obtained via an integration of the differential data for Cu and Zn with integral cross-section measurements on brass showed an agreement within ±17%. The experimental data for natCu, natZn and brass were also compared with theoretical data obtained using the modified hybrid nuclear model code ALICE-IPPE (1996) for intermediate energies. The agreement was found to be good up to about 120 MeV. For products rather away from the target elements, large deviations were observed. Using the measured data, an estimation of collimator activation in proton therapy facilities was done.},

abstract = {Nuclear resonance fluorescence is able to non-intrusively interrogate a region space and measure the isotopic content of the material in that space for any element with atomic number greater than that of helium. The technique involves exposing material to a continuous energy distribution of photons and detecting the scattered photons that have a discrete energy distribution unique to an isotope. The interrogating photons, which range from 2 to 8 MeV, are the most penetrating probes and can “see” through many inches of steel. Determination of the chemical components of the material occupying a region of space greatly enhances the identification of threats such as explosives, fissile materials, toxic materials and weapons of mass destruction. Systems can be designed to involve minimal operator intervention, to minimize dose to the sample, and to provide high throughput at commercial seaports, airports and other entry points.},

The decay of radioactive isotopes produced during irradiation was monitored using high-purity germanium gamma spectroscopy over the months following irradiation. Proton fluence was determined using the natAl(p,x)22Na, natCu(p,x)62Zn natCu(p,x)65Zn, and natCu(p,x)56Co monitor reactions. Calculated cross sections were compared against literature values and theoretical TALYS predictions. Notably this work includes the first reported independent cross section measurements of natCu(p,x)58mCo and natCu(p,x)58gCo.},

abstract = {Abstract Cross sections for residual nuclide production by p-induced reactions were measured from thresholds up to 2.6 GeV using accelerators at CERN/Geneve, IPN/Orsay, KFA/J{\"{u}}lich, LANL/Los Alamos, LNS/Saclay, PSI/Villigen, TSL/Uppsala, LUC/Louvain La Neuve. The target elements C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba and Au were investigated. Residual nuclides were measured by X- and $\gamma$-spectrometry and by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The measured cross sections were corrected for interfering secondary particles in experiments with primary proton energies above 200 MeV. Our consistent database covers presently ca 550 nuclear reactions and contains nearly 15000 individual cross sections of which about 10000 are reported here for the first time. They provide a basis for model calculations of the production of cosmogenic nuclides in extraterrestrial matter by solar and galactic cosmic ray protons. They are of importance for many other applications in which medium energy nuclear reactions have to be considered ranging from astrophysics over space and environmental sciences to accelerator technology and accelerator-based nuclear waste transmutation and energy amplification. The experimental data are compared with theoretical ones based on calculations using an INC/E model in form of the HETC/KFA2 code and on the hybrid model of preequilibrium reactions in form of the AREL code.},

I will compare and contrast between them by developing a typology of major ideologies of active Islamic trends that centers specifically on Wahhabism and neo-Wahhabism, salafism and neo- salafism, and Islamism, both moderate and radical. Understanding these trends and their discourses will allow world powers, policymakers, academicians, intellectuals, terrorism experts, journalists, and many others to distinguish between and understand the logic of the radical and the moderate, the active and the inactive, the jihadi and the peaceful, the takfiri and the tolerant, the modern and the traditional, and the rational and irrational.

abstract = {DANSS is a highly segmented 1$\sim$m${}^3$ plastic scintillator detector. Its 2500 one meter long scintillator strips have a Gd-loaded reflective cover. The DANSS detector is placed under an industrial 3.1$\sim$$\mathrm{GW_{th}}$ reactor of the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant 350$\sim$km NW from Moscow. The distance to the core is varied on-line from 10.7$\sim$m to 12.7$\sim$m. The reactor building provides about 50$\sim$m water-equivalent shielding against the cosmic background. DANSS detects almost 5000 $\widetilde\nu_e$ per day at the closest position with the cosmic background less than 3$\%$. The inverse beta decay process is used to detect $\widetilde\nu_e$. Sterile neutrinos are searched for assuming the $4\nu$ model (3 active and 1 sterile $\nu$). The exclusion area in the $\Delta m_{14}^2,\sin^22\theta_{14}$ plane is obtained using a ratio of positron energy spectra collected at different distances. Therefore results do not depend on the shape and normalization of the reactor $\widetilde\nu_e$ spectrum, as well as on the detector efficiency. Results are based on 966 thousand antineutrino events collected at 3 distances from the reactor core. The excluded area covers a wide range of the sterile neutrino parameters up to $\sin^22\theta_{14}<0.01$ in the most sensitive region.},

abstract = {This study develops techno-economic models for assessment of the conversion of biomass to valuable fuel products via fast pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading. The upgrading process produces a mixture of naphtha-range (gasoline blend stock) and diesel-range (diesel blend stock) products. This study analyzes the economics of two scenarios: onsite hydrogen production by reforming bio-oil, and hydrogen purchase from an outside source. The study results for an nth plant indicate that petroleum fractions in the naphtha distillation range and in the diesel distillation range are produced from corn stover at a product value of $3.09/gal ($0.82/liter) with onsite hydrogen production or $2.11/gal ($0.56/liter) with hydrogen purchase. These values correspond to a $0.83/gal ($0.21/liter) cost to produce the bio-oil. Based on these nth plant numbers, product value for a pioneer hydrogen-producing plant is about $6.55/gal ($1.73/liter) and for a pioneer hydrogen-purchasing plant is about $3.41/ gal ($0.92/liter). Sensitivity analysis identifies fuel yield as a key variable for the hydrogen-production scenario. Biomass cost is important for both scenarios. Changing feedstock cost from $50–$100 per short ton changes the price of fuel in the hydrogen production scenario from $2.57–$3.62/gal ($0.68–$0.96/liter).},

These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the US Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides 235,238U and 239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of JENDL-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 MeV neutrons incident on 239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the ENDF/B-VII.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the VII.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for VII.0 for a wide range of MCNP simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 keV are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for ENDF/B-VII.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the ENDF/B-VII.0 publication. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Herman2007,
abstract = {Abstract EMPIRE is a modular system of nuclear reaction codes, comprising various nuclear models, and designed for calculations over a broad range of energies and incident particles. A projectile can be a neutron, proton, any ion (including heavy-ions) or a photon. The energy range extends from the beginning of the unresolved resonance region for neutron-induced reactions (∽ keV) and goes up to several hundred MeV for heavy-ion induced reactions. The code accounts for the major nuclear reaction mechanisms, including direct, pre-equilibrium and compound nucleus ones. Direct reactions are described by a generalized optical model (ECIS03) or by the simplified coupled-channels approach (CCFUS). The pre-equilibrium mechanism can be treated by a deformation dependent multi-step direct (ORION + TRISTAN) model, by a NVWY multi-step compound one or by either a pre-equilibrium exciton model with cluster emission (PCROSS) or by another with full angular momentum coupling (DEGAS). Finally, the compound nucleus decay is described by the full featured Hauser-Feshbach model with $\gamma$-cascade and width-fluctuations. Advanced treatment of the fission channel takes into account transmission through a multiple-humped fission barrier with absorption in the wells. The fission probability is derived in the WKB approximation within the optical model of fission. Several options for nuclear level densities include the EMPIRE-specific approach, which accounts for the effects of the dynamic deformation of a fast rotating nucleus, the classical Gilbert-Cameron approach and pre-calculated tables obtained with a microscopic model based on HFB single-particle level schemes with collective enhancement. A comprehensive library of input parameters covers nuclear masses, optical model parameters, ground state deformations, discrete levels and decay schemes, level densities, fission barriers, moments of inertia and $\gamma$-ray strength functions. The results can be converted into ENDF-6 formatted files using the accompanying code EMPEND and completed with neutron resonances extracted from the existing evaluations. The package contains the full EXFOR (CSISRS) library of experimental reaction data that are automatically retrieved during the calculations. Publication quality graphs can be obtained using the powerful and flexible plotting package ZVView. The graphic user interface, written in Tcl/Tk, provides for easy operation of the system. This paper describes the capabilities of the code, outlines physical models and indicates parameter libraries used by EMPIRE to predict reaction cross sections and spectra, mainly for nucleon-induced reactions. Selected applications of EMPIRE are discussed, the most important being an extensive use of the code in evaluations of neutron reactions for the new US library ENDF/B-VII.0. Future extensions of the system are outlined, including neutron resonance module as well as capabilities of generating covariances, using both KALMAN and Monte-Carlo methods, that are still being advanced and refined.},

SPMB was labeled using Chloramine-T yielding N-succinimidyl para-[76Br]bromobenzoate, which was then conjugated to the antibody. Optimization of the labeling conditions and further conjugation gave a total yield ( mean±maxerror) of 49±2%. The immunoreactivity of the antibodies was retained after labeling.

@article{Goorley2012,
abstract = {MCNP6 is simply and accurately described as the merger of MCNP5 and MCNPX capabilities, but it is much more than the sum of those two computer codes. MCNP6 is the result of five years of effort by the MCNP5 and MCNPX code development teams. These groups of people, residing in Los Alamos National Laboratory?s (LANL) X Computational Physics Division, Monte Carlo Codes Group (XCP-3), and Decision Applications Division, Radiation Transport and Applications Team (D-5), respectively, have combined their code development efforts to produce the next evolution of MCNP. While maintenance and bug fixes will continue for MCNP5 1.60 and MCNPX 2.7.0 for upcoming years, new code development capabilities only will be developed and released in MCNP6. In fact, the initial release of MCNP6 contains 16 new features not previously found in either code. These new features include the abilities to import unstructured mesh geometries from the finite element code Abaqus, to transport photons down to 1.0 eV, to transport electrons down to 10.0 eV, to model complete atomic relaxation emissions, and to generate or read mesh geometries for use with the LANL discrete ordinates code Partisn. The first release of MCNP6, MCNP6 Beta 2, is now available through the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center, and the first production release is expected in calendar year 2012. High confidence in the MCNP6 code is based on its performance with the verification and validation test suites, comparisons to its predecessor codes, the regression test suite, its code development process, and the underlying high-quality nuclear and atomic databases.},

abstract = {Although chelator-based radiolabeling techniques have been used for decades, concerns about the complexity of coordination chemistry, possible altering of pharmacokinetics of carriers, and potential detachment of radioisotopes during imaging have driven the need for developing a simple yet better technique for future radiolabeling. Here, the emerging concept of intrinsically radiolabeled nanoparticles, which could be synthesized using methods such as hot-plus-cold precursors, specific trapping, cation exchange, and proton beam activation, is introduced. Representative examples of using these multifunctional nanoparticles for multimodality molecular imaging are highlighted together with current challenges and future research directions. Although still in the early stages, design and synthesis of intrinsically radiolabeled nanoparticles has shown attractive potential to offer easier, faster, and more specific radiolabeling possibilities for the next generation of molecular imaging.},

abstract = {Summary Theragnostic imaging for radiation oncology is the use of molecular and functional imaging to prescribe the distribution of radiation in four dimensions—the three dimensions of space plus time—of radiotherapy alone or combined with other treatment modalities in an individual patient. Several new imaging targets for positron-emission tomography, single-photon-emission CT, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy allow variations in microenvironmental or cellular phenotypes that modulate the effect of radiation to be mapped in three dimensions. Dose-painting by numbers is a strategy by which the dose distribution delivered by inverse planned intensity-modulated radiotherapy is prescribed in four dimensions. This approach will revolutionise the way that radiotherapy is prescribed and planned and, at least in theory, will improve the therapeutic outcome in terms of local tumour control and side-effects to unaffected tissue},

abstract = {Activation cross sections for (n, p) and (n, $\alpha$) reactions were measured by the activation method in the energy range of 2.1–3.1 MeV. The irradiated target isotopes were 27Al, 41K, 47Ti, 51V, 54Fe, 59Co, 58,61Ni, 65Cu, 67Zn, 69Ga, 79Br, 92Mo, 93Nb, and 96Ru. The cross sections for 41K (n, p) 41Ar, 61Ni (n, p) 61Co, 65Cu (n, p) 65Ni, 67Zn (n, p) 67Cu, 79Br (n, p) 79mSe, 96Ru (n, p) 96m+gTc, and 69Ga (n, $\alpha$) 66Cu reactions were obtained for the first time. Irradiation was from the d-D neutron source of the Fusion Neutronics Source at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. All cross section values were determined relative to those of the 115In (n, n′) 115mIn reaction. To obtain reliable activation cross sections, careful attention was paid to correct neutron irradiation and to correct the measurement of induced activity as well as to determine the mean neutron energy at the irradiation positions. To measure weak activity levels, a highly efficient measuring technique with a well-type High Purity Germanium detector was applied to the activities. The present results were compared against the comprehensive evaluated data in JENDL-3.3,-3.2, and-Activation File 96 as well as in ENDF/B-VI, and FENDL/A-2.0. We concluded that the evaluated data for 41K (n, p) 41Ar, 51V (n, p) 51Ti, 61Ni (n, p) 61Co, 79Br (n, p) 79mSe, 96Ru (n, p) 96m+gTc, 69Ga (n, $\alpha$) 66Cu, and 93Nb (n, $\alpha$) 90mY reactions were overestimated or underestimated by more than 30%.},

In this first article, we discuss neurologic diseases, certain gastrointestinal conditions, and thyroid conditions. The discussion is in the context of those sex- or gender-based aspects of these diseases that should be considered in the performance, interpretation, and reporting of the relevant nuclear medicine studies. Cardiovascular diseases, gynecologic diseases, bone conditions such as osteoporosis, pediatric occurrences of some diseases, human immunodeficiency virus–related conditions, and the radiation dose considerations of nuclear medicine studies are discussed in the other articles in this issue.},

abstract = {We describe the next generation general purpose Evaluated Nuclear Data File, ENDF/B-VII.0, of recommended nuclear data for advanced nuclear science and technology applications. The library, released by the U.S. Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in December 2006, contains data primarily for reactions with incident neutrons, protons, and photons on almost 400 isotopes, based on experimental data and theory predictions. The principal advances over the previous ENDF/B-VI library are the following: (1) New cross sections for U, Pu, Th, Np and Am actinide isotopes, with improved performance in integral validation criticality and neutron transmission benchmark tests; (2) More precise standard cross sections for neutron reactions on H, 6Li, 10B, Au and for 235,238U fission, developed by a collaboration with the {IAEA} and the OECD/NEA Working Party on Evaluation Cooperation (WPEC); (3) Improved thermal neutron scattering; (4) An extensive set of neutron cross sections on fission products developed through a {WPEC} collaboration; (5) A large suite of photonuclear reactions; (6) Extension of many neutron- and proton-induced evaluations up to 150 MeV; (7) Many new light nucleus neutron and proton reactions; (8) Post-fission beta-delayed photon decay spectra; (9) New radioactive decay data; (10) New methods for uncertainties and covariances, together with covariance evaluations for some sample cases; and (11) New actinide fission energy deposition. The paper provides an overview of this library, consisting of 14 sublibraries in the same ENDF-6 format as the earlier ENDF/B-VI library. We describe each of the 14 sublibraries, focusing on neutron reactions. Extensive validation, using radiation transport codes to simulate measured critical assemblies, show major improvements: (a) The long-standing underprediction of low enriched uranium thermal assemblies is removed; (b) The 238U and 208Pb reflector biases in fast systems are largely removed; (c) ENDF/B-VI.8 good agreement for simulations of thermal high-enriched uranium assemblies is preserved; (d) The underprediction of fast criticality of 233,235U and 239Pu assemblies is removed; and (e) The intermediate spectrum critical assemblies are predicted more accurately. We anticipate that the new library will play an important role in nuclear technology applications, including transport simulations supporting national security, nonproliferation, advanced reactor and fuel cycle concepts, criticality safety, fusion, medicine, space applications, nuclear astrophysics, and nuclear physics facility design. The ENDF/B-VII.0 library is archived at the National Nuclear Data Center, BNL, and can be retrieved from www.nndc.bnl.gov.},

abstract = {Experimental angular distributions from (d, p) and (d, n) nuclear reactions involve contributions from incident angular momenta much higher than is compatible with compound nucleus formation, and indicate that these reactions must proceed to a large extent by means of a stripping process. The angular distributions to be expected from a stripping process are calculated, and these are found to be very sensitive to the angular momenta which can be accepted by the initial nucleus, i.e. to the spins and parities of the energy levels involved. In any one case there is found excellent agreement between the experimental curve and just one of the possible theoretical curves, and if the spin and parity of the ground state of the initial nucleus is known, this allows of a determination of the spin and parity of the appropriate level of the final nucleus. In this way it is found, for example, that the ground state of $^{17}$O has spin $\frac{5}{2}$ or $\frac{3}{2}$ and even parity, and that the first excited state of $^{17}$O (0$\cdot $88 MeV above ground) has spin $\frac{1}{2}$ and even parity. Determinations are also made of the spins and parities of the ground states and several excited states of $^{13}$C, $^{15}$N and $^{28}$Al. Families of theoretical curves for a variety of incident and outgoing energies are presented in order to facilitate further spin and parity determinations from future experimental results.},

abstract = {We performed a feasibility study to determine the optimal dosage and time of administration of the monoclonal antibody zirconium-89 (89Zr)-trastuzumab to enable positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive lesions. Fourteen patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer received 37 MBq of 89Zr-trastuzumab at one of three doses (10 or 50 mg for those who were trastuzumab-naive and 10 mg for those who were already on trastuzumab treatment). The patients underwent at least two PET scans between days 2 and 5. The results of the study showed that the best time for assessment of 89Zr-trastuzumab uptake by tumors was 4–5 days after the injection. For optimal PET-scan results, trastuzumab-naive patients required a 50 mg dose of 89Zr-trastuzumab, and patients already on trastuzumab treatment required a 10 mg dose. The accumulation of 89Zr-trastuzumab in lesions allowed PET imaging of most of the known lesions and some that had been undetected earlier. The relative uptake values (RUVs) (mean ± SEM) were 12.8 ± 5.8, 4.1 ± 1.6, and 3.5 ± 4.2 in liver, bone, and brain lesions, respectively, and 5.9 ± 2.4, 2.8 ± 0.7, 4.0 ± 0.7, and 0.20 ± 0.1 in normal liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain tissue, respectively. PET scanning after administration of 89Zr-trastuzumab at appropriate doses allows visualization and quantification of uptake in HER2-positive lesions in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

abstract = {An attractive feature of targeted radionuclide therapy is the ability to select radionuclides and targeting vehicles with characteristics that are best suited for a particular clinical application. One combination that has been receiving increasing attention is the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically reactive to receptors and antigens that are expressed in tumor cells to selectively deliver the ??-particle-emitting radiohalogen astatine-211 (211At) to malignant cell populations. Promising results have been obtained in preclinical models with multiple 211At-labeled mAbs; however, translation of the concept to the clinic has been slow. Impediments to this process include limited radionuclide availability, the need for suitable radiochemistry methods operant at high activity levels and lack of data concerning the toxicity of ??-particle emitters in humans. Nonetheless, two clinical trials have been initiated to date with 211At-labeled mAbs, and others are planned for the near future. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Demay-Drouhard2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.High-spin gadolinium(III) and manganese(II) complexes have emerged as alternatives to standard nitroxide radical spin labels for measuring nanometric distances by using pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR or DEER) at high fields/frequencies. For certain complexes, particularly those with relatively small zero-field splitting (ZFS) and short distances between the two metal centers, the pseudosecular term of the dipolar coupling Hamiltonian is non-negligible. However, in general, the contribution from this term during conventional data analysis is masked by the flexibility of the molecule of interest and/or the long tethers connecting them to the spin labels. The efficient synthesis of a model system consisting of two [Mn(dota)]2- (MnDOTA; DOTA4-=1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate) directly connected to the ends of a central rodlike oligo(phenylene-ethynylene) (OPE) spacer is reported. The rigidity of the OPE is confirmed by Q-band PELDOR measurements on a bis-nitroxide analogue. The MnII-MnII distance distribution profile determined by W-band PELDOR is in reasonable agreement with one simulated by using a simple rotamer analysis. The small degree of flexibility arising from the linking MnDOTA arm appears to outweigh the contribution from the pseudosecular term at this interspin distance. This study illustrates the potential of MnDOTA-based spin labels for measuring fairly short nanometer distances, and also presents an interesting candidate for in-depth studies of pulsed dipolar spectroscopy methods on MnII-MnII systems.},

Partial ?-ray cross sections for transitions in 45-48Ti, 45-48Sc, and 43-45Ca were determined. The observation of about 130 transitions from 11 different isotopes in the present work provides a demanding test of reaction model calculations, and is the first study in this mass region to extract partial ?-ray cross sections for many different reaction channels over a wide range of incident neutron energies. The neutrons were produced by the Los Alamos National Laboratory spallation neutron source located at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center/Weapons Neutron Research facility. The prompt-reaction ? rays were detected with the large-scale Compton-suppressed GErmanium Array for Neutron Induced Excitations (GEANIE). Event neutron energies were determined by the time-of-flight technique. The ?-ray excitation functions were converted to partial ?-ray cross sections and then compared with model calculations using the enhanced GNASH reaction code. Compound nuclear, preequilibrium emission, and direct reaction mechanisms are included. Overall, the model calculations of the partial ?-ray cross sections are in good agreement with measured values.},

Cross sections for He and Ne in natural Mg, Al, and Si, for He in CaF2, and for Ar in natural Ca were determined by mass spectrometric measurements of the inert gases. Cross sections for formation of 22Na in natural Al and Si, 48V in natural Ti, and 51Cr, 52Mn, and 57Co in stainless steel (type 302) were determined by measurements of the radioactive products by standard ? ray spectrometry. From the stainless steel foil data, cross sections for production of 51Cr and 52Mn in natural Cr were deduced. The results reveal strong similarities between the Mg?Ne, Si?Ne, and Ca?Ar systems. The most salient characteristic of the Al?Ne system is the relatively low yield of 21Ne.},

@article{Muller2014,
abstract = {In recent years, 47Sc has attracted attention because of its favorable decay characteristics (half-life, 3.35 d; average energy, 162 keV; E$\gamma$, 159 keV) for therapeutic application and for SPECT imaging. The aim of the present study was to investigate the suitability of 47Sc for radionuclide therapy in a preclinical setting. For this purpose a novel DOTA-folate conjugate (cm10) with an albumin-binding entity was used. Methods: 47Sc was produced via the 46Ca(n,$\gamma$)47Ca47Sc nuclear reaction at the high-flux reactor at the Institut Laue-Langevin. Separation of the 47Sc from the target material was performed by a semi-automated process using extraction chromatography and cation exchange chromatography. 47Sc-labeled cm10 was tested on folate receptor–positive KB tumor cells in vitro. Biodistribution and SPECT imaging experiments were performed in KB tumor–bearing mice. Radionuclide therapy was conducted with two groups of mice, which received either 47Sc-cm10 (10 MBq) or only saline. Tumor growth and survival time were compared between the two groups of mice. Results: Irradiation of 46Ca resulted in approximately 1.8 GBq of 47Ca, which subsequently decayed to 47Sc. Separation of 47Sc from 47Ca was obtained with 80% yield in only 10 min. The 47Sc was then available in a small volume (∼500 $\mu$L) of an ammonium acetate/HCl (pH 4.5) solution suitable for direct radiolabeling. 47Sc-cm10 was prepared with a radiochemical yield of more than 96% at a specific activity of up to 13 MBq/nmol. In vitro 47Sc-cm10 showed folate receptor–specific binding and uptake into KB tumor cells. In vivo SPECT/CT images allowed the visualization of accumulated radioactivity in KB tumors and in the kidneys. The therapy study showed a significantly delayed tumor growth in mice, which received 47Sc-cm10 (10 MBq, 10 Gy) resulting in a more than 50% increase in survival time, compared with untreated control mice. Conclusion: With this study, we demonstrated the suitability of using 47Sc for therapeutic purposes. On the basis of our recent results obtained with 44Sc-folate, the present work confirms the applicability of 44Sc/47Sc as an excellent matched pair of nuclides for PET imaging and radionuclide therapy.},

The emission rate of conversion electrons plus$\beta$−-particles was determined with a 4$\pi$ proportional flow counter. The total andK-shell internal conversion coefficients of the 336 keV$\gamma$-ray in115In were measured by the electron X-ray coincidence method using combinations of a Si surface barrier with a NaI(Tl) detector and of a magnetic$\beta$-spectrometer with a high energy resolution Si(Li) detector, respectively. The conversion ratioR=K/(L+M+...) was deduced from electron spectra recorded with the magnetic$\beta$-spectrometer. The 336 keV$\gamma$-ray emission rate of all used sources was determined with a calibrated NaI(Tl)$\gamma$-ray spectrometer. A Ge(Li) detector has been used to determine the relative intensity of the 497 keV$\gamma$-ray in115Sn. As results have been deduced the 336 keV$\gamma$-ray emission per decay (N$\gamma$1/N0=(45.9 {\textpm} 0.1){\%}), the total internal conversion coefficient ($\alpha$=1.073 {\textpm} 0.014), theK-shell internal conversion coefficient ($\alpha$K=0.843{\textpm}0.012), the conversion ratioR=3.63{\textpm}0.07, the$\beta$−-transition per decay going to the ground state (N$\beta$1/N0=(5.0 {\textpm} 0.7){\%}) and to the first excited level in115Sn115Sn(N$\beta$2/N0=(0.047 {\textpm} 0.002){\%}), and the 497 keV$\gamma$-ray emission (N$\gamma$2/N$\gamma$1=(0.103 {\textpm} 0.004){\%}). From the obtained internal conversion data it follows that the 336 keV$\gamma$-ray transition is ofM4 character with anE5 admixture of less than (3.5{\textpm}1.5){\%}. The half-life of the isomeric state115mIn has been determined with four different methods. The result isT1/2=(4.486{\textpm}0.004) h.},

The minimum work requirement to separate CO2 from coal-fired flue gas and compress CO2 to 150 bar is 0.11 megawatt-hours per metric ton of CO2. Process and solvent improvements should reduce the energy consumption to 0.2 megawatt-hour per ton of CO2.

However, the lack of a well-quantified, predictive theoretical capability means that most nuclear observables must be measured directly and used to calibrate empirical models, which in turn provide the data needed for these applications. In many cases, either there is a lack of data needed to guide the models or the results of the different measurements are discrepant, leading to the development of evaluation methodologies to provide recommended values and uncertainties. In this review, we describe the nuclear data evaluation process and the international community that carries it out. We then discuss new measurements and improved theory and/or modeling needed to address future challenges in applied nuclear science.},

abstract = {211At-labeled tumor-specific antibodies have long been considered for the treatment of disseminated cancer. However, the limited availability of the nuclide and the poor efficacy of labeling procedures at clinical activity levels present major obstacles to their use. This study evaluated a procedure for the direct astatination of antibodies for the production of clinical activity levels. Methods: The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab was conjugated with the reagent N-succinimidyl-3-(trimethylstannyl)benzoate, and the immunoconjugate was labeled with astatine. Before astatination of the conjugated antibody, the nuclide was activated with N-iodosuccinimide. The labeling reaction was evaluated in terms of reaction time, volume of reaction solvent, immunoconjugate concentration, and applied activity. The quality of the astatinated antibodies was determined by in vitro analysis and biodistribution studies in nude mice. Results: The reaction proceeded almost instantaneously, and the results indicated a low dependence on immunoconjugate concentration and applied activity. Radiochemical labeling yields were in the range of 68%−81%, and a specific radioactivity of up to 1 GBq/mg could be achieved. Stability and radiochemical purity were equal to or better than those attained with a conventional 2-step procedure. Dissociation constants for directly astatinated, conventionally astatinated, and radioiodinated trastuzumab were 1.0 ± 0.06 (mean ± SD), 0.44 ± 0.06, and 0.29 ± 0.02 nM, respectively. The tissue distribution in non–tumor-bearing nude mice revealed only minor differences in organ uptake relative to that obtained with the conventional method. Conclusion: The direct astatination procedure enables the high-yield production of astatinated antibodies with radioactivity in the amounts required for clinical applications.},

abstract = {The anti–human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) antibody trastuzumab is administered to patients with HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer. Whole-body noninvasive HER2/neu scintigraphy could help to assess and quantify the HER2/neu expression of all lesions, including nonaccessible metastases. The aims of this study were to develop clinical-grade radiolabeled trastuzumab for clinical HER2/neu immunoPET scintigraphy, to improve diagnostic imaging, to guide antibody-based therapy, and to support early antibody development. The PET radiopharmaceutical 89Zr-trastuzumab was compared with the SPECT tracer 111In-trastuzumab, which we have tested in the clinic already. Methods: Trastuzumab was labeled with 89Zr and (for comparison) with 111In. The minimal dose of trastuzumab required for optimal small-animal PET imaging and biodistribution was determined with human HER2/neu-positive or -negative tumor xenograft–bearing mice. Results: Trastuzumab was efficiently radiolabeled with 89Zr at a high radiochemical purity and specific activity. The antigen-binding capacity was preserved, and the radiopharmaceutical proved to be stable for up to 7 d in solvent and human serum. Of the tested protein doses, the minimal dose of trastuzumab (100 $\mu$g) proved to be optimal for imaging. The comparative biodistribution study showed a higher level of 89Zr-trastuzumab in HER2/neu-positive tumors than in HER2/neu-negative tumors, especially at day 6 (33.4 ± 7.6 [mean ± SEM] vs. 7.1 ± 0.7 percentage injected dose per gram of tissue). There were good correlations between the small-animal PET images and the biodistribution data and between 89Zr-trastuzumab and 111In-trastuzumab uptake in tumors (R2 = 0.972). Conclusion: Clinical-grade 89Zr-trastuzumab showed high and HER2/neu-specific tumor uptake at a good resolution.},

@article{Henriksen2003,
abstract = {The bone-seeking property and the potential exposure of red marrow by the $\alpha$-particle emitter 223Ra (half-life, 11.43 d) were compared with those of the $\beta$-emitter 89Sr (half-life, 50.53 d). Methods: The biodistributions of 223Ra and 89Sr were studied in mice. Tissue uptake was determined at 1 h, 6 h, 1 d, 3 d, and 14 d after intravenous administration. Radiation absorbed doses were calculated for soft tissues and for bone. Multicellular-level doses were estimated for bone marrow cavities. Results: Both 89Sr and 223Ra selectively concentrated on bone surfaces relative to soft tissues. The measured bone uptake of 223Ra was slightly higher than that of 89Sr. At 24 h, the femur uptake of 223Ra was 40.1% ± 7.7% of the administered activity per gram of tissue. The uptake in spleen and most other soft tissues was higher for 223Ra than for 89Sr. Although predominant clearance of 223Ra was observed from the soft tissues within the first 24 h, the bone uptake of 223Ra, which was not significantly different from maximum after only 1 h, was not significantly reduced during the 14 d. Furthermore, little redistribution of 223Ra daughter products away from bone was found (2% at 6 h and less than 1% at 3 d). Estimates of dose to marrow cavities showed that the 223Ra $\alpha$-emitter might have a marrow-sparing advantage compared with $\beta$-emitters for targeting osteoid surfaces because the short-range $\alpha$-particles irradiate a significantly lower fraction of the marrow volumes. At the same time, the bone surfaces will receive a therapeutically effective radiation dose. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that 223Ra is a promising candidate for high-linear-energy transfer $\alpha$-particle irradiation of cancer cells on bone surfaces. 223Ra can, together with its daughter radionuclides, deliver an intense and highly localized radiation dose to the bone surfaces with substantially less irradiation of healthy bone marrow compared with standard bone-seeking $\beta$-emitters.},

In this case precise analytical calculation of the proton final energy is a rather complicated task, thus the Monte Carlo simulation stands out as a solution. We used the GEANT4.8.2 code to calculate the proton final energy spectra after passing a thick Al absorber and compared it with the same conditions of the experimental data. The ICRU49, Ziegler85 and Ziegler2000 models from the low energy extension pack were used. The results were also compared with the SRIM2008 and MCNPX2.4 simulations, and with solutions of the Boltzmann transport equation in the Fokker–Planck approximation.},

abstract = {The term ''fast pyrolysis'' has been used to describe a pyrolysis regime in which vapor production is enhanced and char minimized by rapid heating. It has been found in the last decade that high yields of primary pyrolysis oil can be achieved using fast pyrolysis. More recently it has been found that the pyrolysis vapors can be converted to high grade fuels using a catalyst. This makes fast pyrolysis of biomass desirable for synthetic fuel manufacture. The authors present results derived from the Diebold Integrated Kinetic Model (DKM) that predict the time, the temperature, and the products of pyrolysis and the heat for pyrolysis of cellulose as a function of heating rates between 0.01 and 10/sup 5/C/min. This range covers very slow pyrolysis requiring days to fast pyrolysis occurring in fractions of a second. The predictions are in good qualitative agreement with experimental measurements. They then compare the heat flux required for slow and fast pyrolysis for particles with that which can be obtained with practical heating devices. The comparison shows that convective and radiative heat transfer is adequate for fast pyrolysis of small particles, but not for large particles, due to conduction to the interior.},

The simulation yields reliable nuclear-reaction-wise energy spectra, or so-called exclusive spectra, for emitted neutrons and -rays, which are required in particle transport calculations for nuclear applications. The Monte Carlo method is applied to neutron-induced nuclear reactions on 56Fe, and the results are compared with a traditional deterministic method. The neutron and -ray emission correlation is examined by gating on an 847 keV -ray that is produced by an inelastic scattering process. The partial -ray energy spectra for different -ray multiplicities are inferred using this Monte Carlo method. In addition, we investigate a correlation between two neutrons in the (n,2n) reaction.},

@article{Dahle2006a,
abstract = {Abstract Radioimmunotherapy has proven clinically effective in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Radioimmunotherapy trials have so far been performed with $\beta$-emitting isotopes. In contrast to $\beta$-emitters, the shorter range and high linear energy transfer (LET) of $\alpha$ particles allow for more efficient and selective killing of individually targeted tumor cells. However, there are several obstacles to the use of $\alpha$-particle immunotherapy, including problems with chelation chemistry and nontarget tissue toxicity. The $\alpha$-emitting radioimmunoconjugate 227Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab is a new potential anti-lymphoma agent that might overcome some of these difficulties. The present study explores the immunoreactivity, in vivo stability and biodistribution, as well as the effect on in vitro cell growth, of this novel radioimmunoconjugate. To evaluate in vivo stability, uptake in balb/c mice of the $\alpha$-particle-emitting nuclide 227Th alone, the chelated form, 227Th-p-nitrobenzyl-DOTA and the radioimmunoconjugate 227Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab was compared in a range of organs at increasing time points after injection. The immunoreactive fraction of 227Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab was 56–65%. During the 28 days after injection of radioimmunoconjugate only, very modest amounts of the 227Th had detached from DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab, indicating a relevant stability in vivo. The half-life of 227Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab in blood was 7.4 days. Incubation of lymphoma cells with 227Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab resulted in a significant antigen-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The data presented here warrant further studies of 227Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab.},

@article{DiSalvo1999,
abstract = {In a typical thermoelectric device, a junction is formed from two different conducting materials, one containing positive charge carriers (holes) and the other negative charge carriers (electrons). When an electric current is passed in the appropriate direction through the junction, both types of charge carriers move away from the junction and convey heat away, thus cooling the junction. Similarly, a heat source at the junction causes carriers to flow away from the junction, making an electrical generator. Such devices have the advantage of containing no moving parts, but low efficiencies have limited their use to specialty applications, such as cooling laser diodes. The principles of thermoelectric devices are reviewed and strategies for increasing the efficiency of novel materials are explored. Improved materials would not only help to cool advanced electronics but could also provide energy benefits in refrigeration and when using waste heat to generate electrical power. },

abstract = {Radioactive 82Sr/82Rb produced at Los Alamos National Laboratory is routinely used in generators for hospitals and medical laboratories to support cardiac imaging. The proper quantification of strontium radioisotopes in a sample is important to ensure quality and regulatory compliance. However, the quantification of the impurity 85Sr is difficult, because its primary gamma-ray at 514 keV interferes with the annihilation peak at 511 keV from 82Rb. Synthetic spectra were created as a quality test of several gamma-ray spectral analysis tools' ability to resolve peaks in the 511/514 keV multiplet. The peak fitting results from the spectroscopy tools (RAYGUN, SPECANAL, GammaVision, UNISAMPO, and GAMANAL) are presented. These spectra can also be useful for other programs to test their annihilation peak analysis procedures.},

High specific activity 47Sc can be produced by irradiating enriched 47Ti in sufficient quantities needed for therapeutic applications. A new separation technique based on column chromatography was developed. Neutron irradiated titanium was dissolved in hydrofluoric acid, which was evaporated and taken in distilled water. The resulting solution was loaded on silica gel column. The radioactive scandium comes out first and the inactive titanium is removed with 2 M HCl. More than 95{%} radioactive scandium was recovered, while chemical impurity of titanium determined by optical emission spectroscopy was less than 0.01 $\mu$g/mL in final product.},

abstract = {We have improved a pneumatic sample transport system that enables activation cross-sections to be measured by producing short-lived nuclei on the order of sub-millibarns. The irradiation distances between the d-D neutron source and the samples ranged from 20 to 65 mm at six angles of between 0° and 155°. The neutron fluence rates were between 1×108 and 5×106 n/cm2/s in the 2.1–3.1 MeV range, and these values were between 24 and 3 times higher than those of the previous system, which used a distance of 100 mm, at the Fusion Neutronics Source at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. The energy spreads at the irradiation positions were calculated by taking into account the slowing of incident 350-keV deuterons, the self-loaded deuteron distribution in the Ti-target and the solid angle subtended by the irradiated sample. At each angle, the acceptable close distance was found to be about 20 mm under the condition of an energy spread of less than about 300 keV. The spreads at about 0° and 180° were determined mainly by the slowing of deuterons in the target, while those at about 90° were determined by the finite solid angle. The activation cross-sections of 27Al (n, p) 27Mg and 61Ni (n, p) 61Co reactions were obtained for test measurements. This was undertaken with the prospect of using the present system to systematically measure the activation cross-sections down to a sub-millibarn level.},

abstract = {Biodiesel, defined as monoalkyl fatty acid ester (preferentially methyl and ethyl esters), represents a promising alternative fuel for use in compression-ignition (diesel) engines. Biodiesel fuel comes from renewable sources as it is plant- not petroleum-derived and as such it is biodegradable and less toxic. In addition, relative to conventional diesel, its combustion products have reduced levels of particulates, carbon oxides, sulphur oxides and, under some conditions, nitrogen oxides. Enzymatic production of biodiesel has been proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional chemically catalyzed processes. The main obstacle facing full exploitation of the enzyme, lipase, potential is its cost. Therefore, reuse of lipase is essential from the economic point of view, which can be achieved by using the lipase in immobilized form. In addition, immobilized lipase displays improved stability and activity. Common immobilization techniques include attachment to solid supports and entrapment within the matrix of a polymer. This article presents a comparison between conventional processes and enzymatic processes and different possible feedstocks for biodiesel production. In addition, possible ways to overcome the problems facing the use of lipase are described. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract = {Purpose: Manganese(II) is employed as a contrast agent with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for study of neuronal activation in rats and mice. However, at the concentrations required for MRI, Mn may induce pharmacological or toxic effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of52MnCl2 at tracer doses has the potential to allow similar Mn studies as manganese-enhanced MRI while providing quantitative results and avoiding toxic effects. In this work, 52MnCl2 is produced and characterized as a PET tracer in phantoms and in rats. Methods: 52MnCl2 was produced by proton irradiation of natural Cr foil and separated by column chromatography. Images were acquired on a Siemens Focus 120 small animal PET scanner. Phantom images were acquired to assess uniformity, resolution, cascade background correction, and count rate linearity. Images of rats were also acquired after systemic and intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of 52MnCl2 to investigate Mn(II) distribution in vivo. Results: Irradiation yield was 74.6 ± 8.5 kBq/?A?min 52Mn at end of bombardment with initial specific activity of at least 3.5 MBq/nmol. 52Mn PET images show similar uniformity and resolution to 18F. 18F based detector efficiency normalization is adequate for 52Mn imaging. Subtraction of a rescaled random events distribution from sinogram data is effective for cascade correction of 52Mn PET data. After systemic injection, 52Mn appears in structures throughout the body of rats, including bones, liver, intestines, and the pituitary gland, but does not appear detectably throughout the brain. After ICV injection, 52Mn remains in the brain and spinal cord. Conclusions: 52Mn is a promising tracer for small animal PET imaging, yielding image quality comparable to 18F. Potential applications include studies similar to Mn-enhanced neuronal MRI, and in other organ systems including bones, spinal cord, and the digestive tract.},

abstract = {Nuclear spectroscopic information for experimentally investigated nuclides of mass 32 (Ne,Na,Mg,Al,Si, P,S,Cl,Ar) has been evaluated. The principal sources of the Adopted Levels presented for nuclides close to the stability line are Endtʼs evaluations (1990En08,1978En02). The data sets for reactions and decays, including all available gamma-ray data, are based mostly on the original literature. Except for the half-life of 32Ne decay, no other details about its decay characteristics are available. Structure data for 32Ne and 32Na are limited to only one excited state in each. The 32Mg nuclide is of central and prime relevance in the ‘island of inversion' at or near N=20 semi-closed shell. The lifetime of only one excited state in 32Mg is known. The spin-parity assignments of several levels in this nucleus are not quite firm. The structure of 32Ar is limited to only one known state at low energy and two resonances in the giant-dipole excitation region. The 32P, 32S and 32Cl remain the most extensively studied nuclei through various reaction channels.},

@incollection{Falzone2012,
abstract = {Radionuclides that emit Auger electrons have been of particular interest as therapeutic agents. This is primarily due to the short range in tissue, controlled linear paths and high linear energy transfer of these particles. Taking into consideration that ionizations are clustered within several cubic nanometers around the point of decay the possibility of incorporating an Auger emitter in close proximity to the cancer cell DNA has immense therapeutic potential thus making nuclear targeted Auger-electron emitters ideal for precise targeting of cancer cells. Furthermore, many Auger-electron emitters also emit $\gamma$-radiation, this property makes Auger emitting radionuclides a very attractive option as therapeutic and diagnostic agents in the molecular imaging and management of tumors. The first requirement for the delivery of Auger emitting nuclides is the definition of suitable tumor-selective delivery vehicles to avoid normal tissue toxicity. One of the main challenges of targeted radionuclide therapy remains in matching the physical and chemical characteristics of the radionuclide and targeting moiety with the clinical character of the tumor. Molecules and molecular targets that have been used in the past can be classified according to the carrier molecule used to deliver the Auger-electron-emitting radionuclide. These include (1) antibodies, (2) peptides, (3) small molecules, (4) oligonucleotides and peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), (5) proteins, and (6) nanoparticles. The efficacy of targeted radionuclide therapy depends greatly on the ability to increase intranuclear incorporation of the radiopharmaceutical without compromising toxicity. Several strategies to achieve this goal have been proposed in literature. The possibility of transferring tumor therapy based on the emission of Auger electrons from experimental models to patients has vast therapeutic potential, and remains a field of intense research.},

abstract = {Investigation of 45Ti-transferrin was pursued to provide insight into the mechanism of action of titanocene dichloride, a chemotherapeutic agent currently in clinical trials. Methods: Plasma protein-binding studies of processed 45Ti were performed by solubilizing the 45Ti residue in 0.05N HCl, of which 1.22 MBq (33 $\mu$Ci) in 10 $\mu$L were added to 250 $\mu$L of dog plasma. 45Ti-Transferrin was prepared by redissolving the processed 45Ti in 25 $\mu$mol/L apotransferrin or by in vivo incorporation through preparation and introduction of 45Ti-citrate. Biodistribution studies were performed on normal Sprague–Dawley rats and EMT-6 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice with 45Ti-transferrin coinjected with 67Ga-citrate for direct comparison. microPET was performed on mice bearing EMT-6 tumors and the images were analyzed for tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios. Results: Direct labeling of apotransferrin in situ with 45Ti was achieved as well as in vivo incorporation by 2 h after injection with 45Ti-citrate. The biodistribution of 45Ti-transferrin and 67Ga-citrate showed similar trends. In Sprague–Dawley rats, initial blood uptake was higher for the 45Ti-transferrin, whereas bone uptake increased more for the 67Ga-citrate. EMT-6 tumor uptake in both cases was relatively high (14.6 ± 1.83 %ID/g for 45Ti and 8.72 ± 0.98 %ID/g for 67Ga [%ID/g = percentage injected dose per gram]) and remained elevated even out to 24 h after injection. The tumor-to-muscle ratio of the 67Ga-citrate reached 6.7 at 24 h, whereas the ratio of the 45Ti-transferrin increased to 4.3 at this time point. Uptake of 45Ti-transferrin was visualized in the EMT-6 murine mammary carcinoma tumor with microPET. In all cases, the tumor was clearly delineated from the surrounding tissue with tumor-to-muscle ratios on the order of 1.6. Conclusion: 45Ti forms a complex with apotransferrin that remains intact in vivo. Results of the biodistribution in mice showed that the tumor had increased uptake compared with nontarget organs (e.g., muscle). The microPET images of tumor-bearing mice clearly delineate the tumors from the surrounding tissue. Comparison of the data suggests that tissue uptake is similar whether injecting 45Ti-transferrin directly or as 45Ti-citrate, which transchelates to transferrin before the time of imaging.},

@article{Verel2003,
abstract = {The use of immuno-PET, the combination of PET with mono-clonal antibodies (mAbs), is an attractive option to improve tumor detection and mAb quantification. The long-lived positron emitter 89 Zr has ideal physical characteristics for immuno-PET, such as a half-life of 3.27 d, which is compatible with the time needed for intact mAbs to achieve optimal tumor-to-nontumor ratios. Thus far, a major limitation in the use of 89 Zr has been the lack of suitable methods for its stable coupling to mAbs. In this article, practical protocols for reproducible isolation of highly pure 89 Zr and the production of optimal-quality mAb-89 Zr con-jugates are provided. Methods: 89 Zr was produced by a (p,n) reaction on natural yttrium (89 Y), isolated with a hydroxamate column, and used for labeling of premodified mAbs. mAbs were premodified with a novel bifunctional derivative of the chelate desferrioxamine B (Df) via a new linker chemistry. To this end, Df was initially succinylated (N-sucDf), temporarily filled with Fe(III), esterified by use of tetrafluorophenol, and then directly coupled to mAbs. Chimeric mAb (cmAb) U36, directed against head and neck cancer, was used for in vitro and in vivo evaluation. The in vitro stability of cmAb U36-N-sucDf-89 Zr was assessed in hu-man serum, and its in vivo behavior was evaluated by biodistri-bution and PET imaging studies in tumor-bearing nude mice. A cmAb U36-Df-89 Zr conjugate containing a previously described succinimide ring–thioether unit in the linker was used as a reference. Results: 89 Zr was produced in large batches (6.5– 13.5 GBq) and isolated with improved radionuclidic purity (Ͼ99.99%) and high yield (Ͼ94%). The Df-premodified mAbs gave 89 Zr-labeling efficiencies of 80% within 30 min, resulting in conjugates with preserved integrity and immunoreactivity. With respect to stability, the novel cmAb U36-N-sucDf-89 Zr conju-gate appeared to be superior to the reference conjugate. In vivo, the novel conjugate demonstrated selective tumor targeting, and on PET images obtained at 24, 48, and 72 h after injection of this conjugate, small tumors in the range of 19 –154 mg were readily visualized. Conclusion: Methods were developed for improved purification of the long-lived positron emitter 89 Zr. Moreover, a novel bifunctional Df chelate was synthesized for the reproducible coupling of 89 Zr to mAbs. The suitability of such conjugates to detect millimeter-sized tumors in xenograft-bearing nude mice was demonstrated. Radi olabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have shown considerable potential for diagnosis and treatment of cancer (1,2). In recently performed clinical radioimmu-noscintigraphy and radioimmunotherapy studies at our in-stitute, the potential of the CD44 variant 6 –specific mAb U36 for these purposes has been demonstrated (3,4). For the detection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), primary tumors as well as metastases, radioim-munoscintigraphy with 99m Tc-labeled mAb U36 IgG was found to be as valuable as the conventional imaging tech-niques CT and MRI, but the detection of tumor deposits smaller than 1 cm appeared to be a problem (3). Introduc-tion of PET might further improve tumor detection because of its high resolution. In addition, PET has potential for quantitative imaging. These features should enable PET to provide proof of principle of antibody targeting and dosi-metric determinations before radioimmunotherapy. For this purpose, we are focusing on the coupling of positron emit-ters to mAbs and the use of these radiolabeled mAbs in immuno-PET. For a positron emitter to be appropriate for immuno-PET, it has to fulfill several requirements. Its physical half-life has to be compatible with the time needed for a mAb to achieve optimal tumor-to-nontumor ratios. For intact mAbs used for targeting solid tumors, this time is generally 2– 4 d. Therefore, commonly used positron emitters such as 11 C and 18 F (half-lives of 20 and 110 min, respectively) are not suitable for labeling of mAbs. With respect to decay},

abstract = {Pretargeting involves administration of a tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb) covalently linked to a molecule having a high-affinity binding site for a rapidly distributed radiolabeled effector molecule. The aim of this study was to compare pretargeting to a conventionally labeled antibody for tumor targeting of the intermediate-lived radionuclide 64Cu, which has shown promise for PET imaging and radioimmunotherapy of cancer. Methods: DOTA-biotin (where DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N′,N″,N‴-tetraacetic acid) and the intact immunoconjugate DOTA-NR-LU-10 were labeled to high specific activities with 64Cu, and the serum stabilities and target binding capabilities of each agent were assayed in vitro. Nude mice bearing SW1222 human colorectal carcinoma xenografts were administered 64Cu-DOTA-biotin, with and without pretreatment with the mAb-streptavidin conjugate NR-LU-10/SA and the synthetic clearing agent Biotin-GalNAc16, or injected with 64Cu-DOTA-NR-LU-10. Biodistributions of both agents were obtained from 5 min to 48 h after injection. Results: Both 64Cu-DOTA-biotin and 64Cu-DOTA-NR-LU-10 were 100% stable in serum in vitro. 64Cu-DOTA-biotin exhibited >98% specific binding to immobilized streptavidin, whereas the immunoreactivity of 64Cu-DOTA-NR-LU-10 averaged nearly 80%. Biodistributions in SW1222-bearing mice showed that NR-LU-10/SA–pretargeted 64Cu-DOTA-biotin attained a peak tumor uptake of 18.9 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at 1 h, with concomitant rapid disappearance from blood and renal excretion. In the absence of pretargeting, 64Cu-DOTA-biotin had very similar biodistribution and clearance properties, except with extremely low nonspecific tumor uptake. In contrast, 64Cu-DOTA-NR-LU-10 reached 80.3 %ID/g in tumor tissue, after 48 h, whereas blood clearance was considerably slower than pretargeted 64Cu-DOTA-biotin. Comparison of the time–activity curves for tumor uptake and blood clearance of pretargeted 64Cu and the 64Cu-labeled antibody revealed that the maximum tumor accumulations of radioactivity were similar for each agent, 17.9 percentage injected activity per gram (%IA/g) and 20.7 %IA/g, respectively. However, the tumor-to-blood ratio of areas under the curves was 14 times higher for pretargeted 64Cu-DOTA-biotin because of the substantial increase in blood clearance of the small effector molecule. Conclusion: The extremely rapid tumor uptake and blood clearance of pretargeted 64Cu-DOTA-biotin should afford markedly superior PET imaging contrast and therapeutic efficacy, compared with conventionally labeled 64Cu-DOTA-NR-LU-10. Further comparison of the therapeutic efficacy, toxicity, and dosimetry of these 2 agents is warranted.},

abstract = {Manganese has long been employed as a T1-shortening agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications, but these techniques are limited by the biotoxicity of bulk-manganese. Positron emission tomography (PET) offers superior contrast sensitivity compared with MRI, and recent preclinical PET studies employing 52gMn (t1/2: 5.6 d, $\beta$+: 29%) show promise for a variety of applications including cell tracking, neural tract tracing, immunoPET, and functional $\beta$-cell mass quantification. The half-life and confounding gamma emissions of 52gMn are prohibitive to clinical translation, but the short-lived 51Mn (t1/2: 46 min, $\beta$+: 97%) represents a viable alternative. This work develops methods to produce 51Mn on low-energy medical cyclotrons, characterizes the in vivo behavior of 51MnCl2 in mice, and performs preliminary human dosimetry predictions. 51Mn was produced by proton irradiation of electrodeposited isotopically-enriched 54Fe targets. Radiochemically isolated 51MnCl2 was intravenously administered to ICR mice which were scanned by dynamic and static PET, followed by ex vivo gamma counting. Rapid blood clearance was observed with stable uptake in the pancreas, kidneys, liver, heart, and salivary gland. Dosimetry calculations predict that 370 MBq of 51Mn in an adult human male would yield an effective dose equivalent of approximately 13.5 mSv, roughly equivalent to a clinical [18F]-FDG procedure.},

New high spin levels for 87Rb were observed, indicating possible neutron core excitations. In addition, the ground state lifetime of 87Rb has been revised and a new lifetime measurement for an excited level in 87Rb indicates a possible proton spin flip. New excitation levels have been observed for the first time in 87Se. New direct and precise measurement of atomic masses of 87Tc, 87Mo, 87Nb, 87Zr, 87Mo and 87Tc have greatly improved the Q value landscape in this mass region.

However, the chemical complexity of natural products also presents one of the main roadblocks for production of these pharmaceuticals on an industrial scale. Chemical synthesis of natural products is often difficult and expensive, and isolation from their natural sources is also typically low yielding. Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering offer an alternative approach that is becoming more accessible as the tools for engineering microbes are further developed. By reconstructing heterologous metabolic pathways in genetically tractable host organisms, complex natural products can be produced from inexpensive sugar starting materials through large-scale fermentation processes. In this Perspective, we discuss ongoing research aimed toward the production of terpenoid natural products in genetically engineered Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

abstract = {A methodology is presented for designing photobioreactors with tubular loop solar receivers in which the fluid is circulated by an airlift device. The design method effectively combines the relevant aspects of external irradiance-dependent cell growth, oxygen accumulation in the solar loop, oxygen removal in the airlift device, and hydrodynamics of the airlift system that determine the flow velocity through the solar receiver. The design approach developed was used to model and build a 0.2 m3 outdoor photobioreactor. A compact degasser in the airlift section eliminated dead zones and dark zones, while achieving complete separation of gas and liquid. The measured gas–liquid hydrodynamics, mass transfer, and culture productivity were consistent with the model predictions. The reactor was tested with continuous culture of the microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum at various liquid velocities through the tubular solar receiver. A biomass productivity of 1.20 g l−1 d−1 (or 20 g m−2 d−1) was obtained at a dilution rate of 0.050 h−1. Solar receiver linear liquid velocities of 0.50 and 0.35 m s−1 gave similar biomass productivities, but the culture collapsed at lower velocities. An adverse effect of high dissolved oxygen concentration on productivity was observed. Oxygen accumulation could be reduced by increasing the liquid velocity and this enhanced the biomass yield.},

abstract = {The January 2012 arrest of Canadian Sub-Lieutenant Jeffery Delisle for supplying Top Secret intelligence to Russia reminded Canadians of Canada's involvement in the Five Eyes intelligence community, the world's most exclusive intelligence sharing club that includes Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. This paper promotes further understanding of the nature and structure of the Five Eyes intelligence community by reviewing three selected intelligence disciplines—signals intelligence (sigint), national assessment, and defence intelligence. The Five Eyes intelligence community grew out of twentieth-century British-American intelligence cooperation. While not monolithic; the group is more cohesive than generally known. Rather than being centrally choreographed, the Five Eyes group is more of a cooperative, complex network of linked autonomous intelligence agencies, interacting with an affinity strengthened by a profound sense of confidence in each other and a degree of professional trust so strong as to be unique in the world. The paper suggests that, given Canadian foreign policy initiatives and evolving strategic security threats, not only must Canada maintain credible and valuable intelligence support to its partners, the Five Eyes intelligence community as a whole must remain integrated, effective and dominant},

abstract = {A new double time-of-flight (dTOF) neutron spectroscopy technique has been developed for pulsed broad spectrum sources with a duty cycle that results in frame overlap, where fast neutrons from a given pulse overtake slower neutrons from previous pulses. Using a tunable beam at the 88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, neutrons were produced via thick-target breakup of 16 MeV deuterons on a beryllium target in the cyclotron vault. The breakup spectral shape was deduced from a dTOF measurement using an array of EJ-309 organic liquid scintillators. Simulation of the neutron detection efficiency of the scintillator array was performed using both GEANT4 and MCNP6. The efficiency-corrected spectral shape was normalized using a foil activation technique to obtain the energy-dependent flux of the neutron beam at zero degrees with respect to the incoming deuteron beam. The dTOF neutron spectrum was compared to spectra obtained using HEPROW and GRAVEL pulse height spectrum unfolding techniques. While the unfolding and dTOF results exhibit some discrepancies in shape, the integrated flux values agree within two standard deviations. This method obviates neutron time-of-flight spectroscopy challenges posed by pulsed beams with frame overlap and opens new opportunities for pulsed white neutron source facilities.},

abstract = {This account briefly traces the growth of our theoretical and experimental knowledge of electron–positron pair production by photons, from the prediction of the positron by Dirac [1928a. The quantum theory of the electron. Proc. R. Soc. (London) A 117, 610–624; 1928b. The quantum theory of the electron. Part II. Proc. R. Soc. (London) A 118, 1928b, 351–361] and subsequent cloud-chamber observations by Anderson [Energies of cosmic-ray particles. Phys. Rev. 43, 491–494], up to the present time. Photons of energies above 2mec2 (1.022 MeV) can interact with the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus to be transformed into an electron–positron pair, the probability increasing with increasing photon energy, up to a plateau at high energies, and increasing with increasing atomic number approximately as the square of the nuclear charge (proton number). This interaction can also take place in the field of an atomic electron, for photons of energy in excess of 4mec2 (2.044 MeV), in which case the process is called triplet production due to the track of the recoiling atomic electron adding to the tracks of the created electron–positron pair. The last systematic computations and tabulations of pair and triplet cross sections, which are the predominant contributions to the photon mass attenuation coefficient for photon energies 10 MeV and higher, were those of Hubbell et al. [Pair, triplet, and total atomic cross sections (and mass attenuation coefficients) for 1 MeV–100 GeV photons in elements Z=1–100. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 9, 1023–1147], from threshold (1.022 MeV) up to 100 GeV, for all elements Z = 1 –100. These computations required some ad hoc bridging functions between the available low-energy and high-energy theoretical models. Recently (1979–2001), Sud and collaborators have developed some new approaches including using distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) theory to compute pair production cross sections in the intermediate energy region (5.0–10.0 MeV) on a firmer theoretical basis. These and other recent developments, and their possible implications for improved computations of pair and triplet cross sections, are discussed.},

abstract = {A thermolysis process for the production of volatiles for an external combustor or liquefaction of biomass solids in which specific and previously unrecognized conditions are employed. The thermolysis is carried out in a single fluidized bed of inert material operating at near atmospheric pressure, relatively low temperature, long solids and gas residence times and moderate heating rates. The distribution of the thermolysis products among, solid (char) and gases under these conditions is unique. The product effluent can be either quenched to produce a high liquid yield in addition to a low char yield or the volatile effluent can be used in either the same combustor or a second combustor to produce heat energy a particularly high efficiency system. In using a quencher, the quenched liquid is of similar composition to those obtained by so called fast pyrolysis processes of the prior art. The specified conditions are such as to allow production of liquids in high yields in an energy efficient manner. The low severity of the conditions in comparison with previous approaches allows simplified process design and scale-up leading to lower capital and operating costs as well as easier control.},

abstract = {AbstractIntroduction The significance of nuclear data in the choice and medical application of a radionuclide is considered: the decay data determine its suitability for organ imaging or internal therapy and the reaction cross section data allow optimisation of its production route. A brief discussion of reaction cross sections and yields is given. Standard radionuclides The standard SPECT, {PET} and therapeutic radionuclides are enumerated and their decay and production data are considered. The status of nuclear data is generally good. Some existing discrepancies are outlined. A few promising alternative production routes of 99mTc and 68Ga are discussed. Research-oriented radionuclides The increasing significance of non-standard positron emitters in organ imaging and of low-energy highly-ionizing radiation emitters in internal therapy is discussed, their nuclear data are considered and a brief review of their status is presented. Some other related nuclear data issues are also mentioned. Production of radionuclides using newer technologies The data needs arising from new directions in radionuclide applications (multimode imaging, theranostic approach, radionanoparticles, etc.) are considered. The future needs of data associated with possible utilization of newer irradiation technologies (intermediate energy cyclotron, high-intensity photon accelerator, spallation neutron source, etc.) are outlined. Conclusion Except for a few small discrepancies, the available nuclear data are sufficient for routine production and application of radionuclides. Considerable data needs exist for developing novel radionuclides for applications. The developing future technologies for radionuclide production will demand further data-related activities.},

Building on a design report published in 2007, NREL and its subcontractor Harris Group Inc. performed a complete review of the process design and economic model for a biomass-to-ethanol process via indirect gasification. The conceptual design presented herein considers the economics of ethanol production, assuming the achievement of internal research targets for 2012 and nth-plant costs and financing. The design features a processing capacity of 2,205 U.S. tons (2,000 metric tonnes) of dry biomass per day and an ethanol yield of 83.8 gallons per dry U.S. ton of feedstock. The ethanol selling price corresponding to this design is $2.05 per gallon in 2007 dollars, assuming a 30-year plant life and 40% equity financing with a 10% internal rate of return and the remaining 60% debt financed at 8% interest. This ethanol selling price corresponds to a gasoline equivalent price of $3.11 per gallon based on the relative volumetric energy contents of ethanol and gasoline.},

abstract = {A facility based on a next-generation, high-flux D-D neutron generator has been commissioned and it is now operational at the University of California, Berkeley. The current generator design produces near monoenergetic 2.45 MeV neutrons at outputs of 10 8 n/s. Calculations provided show that future conditioning at higher currents and voltages will allow for a production rate over 10 10 n/s. A significant problem encountered was beam-induced electron backstreaming, that needed to be resolved to achieve meaningful beam currents. Two methods of suppressing secondary electrons resulting from the deuterium beam striking the target were tested: the application of static electric and magnetic fields. Computational simulations of both techniques were done using a finite element analysis in COMSOL Multiphysics R . Experimental tests verified these simulation results. The most reliable suppression was achieved via the implementation of an electrostatic shroud with a voltage offset of -800 V relative to the target.},

abstract = {Background and purpose CLR1404 is a phospholipid ether that exhibits selective uptake and retention in malignant tissues. Radiolabeled CLR1404 enables tumor-specific positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging (124I) and targeted delivery of ionizing radiation (131I). Here we describe the first preclinical studies of this diapeutic molecule in head and neck cancer (HNC) models. Material and methods Tumor-selective distribution of 124I-CLR1404 and therapeutic efficacy of 131I-CLR1404 were tested in HNC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft tumor models. Monte Carlo dose calculations and 124I-CLR1404 PET/CT imaging were used to examine 131I-CLR1404 dosimetry in preclinical HNC tumor models. Results HNC tumor xenograft studies including patient-derived xenografts demonstrate tumor-selective uptake and retention of 124I-CLR1404 resulting in a model of highly conformal dose distribution for 131I-CLR1404. We observe dose-dependent response to 131I-CLR1404 with respect to HNC tumor xenograft growth inhibition and this effect is maintained together with external beam radiation. Conclusions We confirm the utility of CLR1404 for tumor imaging and treatment of HNC. This promising agent warrants further investigation in a developing phase I trial combining 131I-CLR1404 with reduced-dose external beam radiation in patients with loco-regionally recurrent HNC.},

abstract = {Abstract Nuclear structure data pertaining to all nuclei with mass number A=93 (Se, Br, Kr, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag) have been compiled and evaluated and incorporated into the ENSDF data file. This publication for A=93 supersedes the previous publication by C.M. Baglin, Nuclear Data Sheets 80, 1 (1997) (literature cutoff date November 1996) and subsequent revisions by C.M. Baglin of the ENSDF files for 93Br and 93Kr (literature cutoff 26 February 2001) and for 93Rh (literature cutoff 27 February 2001); it includes all data available prior to 15 December 2010. Significant changes since prior evaluations include the following: 2010Hw03 identified several high-spin states in 93Kr in 252Cf SF decay; in addition to the many low-spin levels already known in 93Rb from $\beta$− decay, several higher-spin states have now been identified in a 252Cf SF decay study (2009Hw03); this SF decay has also been used to identify additional states in 93Sr (2003Hw01) and the 238U(82Se,X$\gamma$) reaction (2007Bu35) has provided new information on 93Y. (HI,xn$\gamma$) reaction studies have expanded our knowledge of the structure of 93Zr (2002Fo03, 2005Pa48), 93Nb (2007Wa45), 93Mo (2005Fu01), 93Tc (2003Ha22) and 93Pd (2004So04,2004Ru02). Considerable information on 93Nb was provided by a (p,2n$\gamma$) study (2010Or01, 2006Or09, 2007Or01). The level schemes of 93Ru, 93Rh and 93Pd have undergone the most extensive revision thanks to studies of 93Rh $\epsilon$ decay (2004De40), 94Ag $\epsilon$p decay (2004Mu30) and 94Ag p decay (2005Mu15, 2005Mu30), respectively. The half-life of the Zr member of this chain is of particular interest because of 93Zrʼs large contribution to long-term activity of nuclear reactor waste and also due to its potential as a supernova chronometer. During 2010, two new well-documented measurements of T1/2(93Zr) were published (2010Ya01 and 2010Ca01); one agrees well with an earlier, undocumented measurement but, unfortunately, the other is many standard deviations lower for reasons which are not immediately apparent.},

The HIVIPP method is very simple and does not require any complicated mechanisms to prepare both supported (backed) and self-supporting targets. The motivation for the present work was a desire to explore whether it could be done successfully with pressures higher than one bar, with reactive gases or inert gases, and without a vacuum-pumping system. The first successful results are reported for depositions of metallic chromium and non-metallic silicon powders in nitrogen, oxygen, and air at >1bar.},

Current strategies for improving plant-based systems include the development of large-scale production facilities as well as the optimisation of protein modifications. While post-translational modifications of plant proteins generally resemble those of mammalian proteins, certain plant-specific protein-linked sugars are immunogenic in humans, a fact that restricts the use of plants in biopharmaceutical production so far. The moss Physcomitrella patens was developed as a contained tissue culture system for recombinant protein production in photo-bioreactors. By targeted gene replacements, moss strains were created with non-immunogenic humanised glycan patterns. These were proven to be superior to currently used mammalian cell lines in producing antibodies with enhanced effectiveness.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Particle–emitting radionuclides, such as 211At, with a 7.2-h half-life, may be optimally suited for the molecularly targeted radiotherapy of strategically sensitive tumor sites, such as those in the central nervous system. Because of the much shorter range and more potent cytotoxicity of $\alpha$-particles than of $\beta$-particles, 211At-labeled agents may be ideal for the eradication of tumor cells remaining after surgical debulking of malignant brain tumors. The main goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility and safety of this approach in patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors. Methods: Chimeric antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 (ch81C6) (10 mg) was labeled with 71–347 MBq of 211At by use of N-succinimidyl 3-[211At]astatobenzoate. Eighteen patients were treated with 211At-labeled ch81C6 (211At-ch81C6) administered into a surgically created resection cavity (SCRC) and then with salvage chemotherapy. Serial $\gamma$-camera imaging and blood sampling over 24 h were performed. Results: A total of 96.7% ± 3.6% (mean ± SD) of 211At decays occurred in the SCRC, and the mean blood-pool percentage injected dose was ≤0.3. No patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity, and the maximum tolerated dose was not identified. Six patients experienced grade 2 neurotoxicity within 6 wk of 211At-ch81C6 administration; this neurotoxicity resolved fully in all but 1 patient. No toxicities of grade 3 or higher were attributable to the treatment. No patient required repeat surgery for radionecrosis. The median survival times for all patients, those with glioblastoma multiforme, and those with anaplastic astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma were 54, 52, and 116 wk, respectively. Conclusion: This study provides proof of concept for regional targeted radiotherapy with 211At-labeled molecules in oncology. Specifically, the regional administration of 211At-ch81C6 is feasible, safe, and associated with a promising antitumor benefit in patients with malignant central nervous system tumors.},

abstract = {The use of monoclonal antibodies to deliver radioisotopes directly to tumor cells has become a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of native antibodies. Since the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-particles emitted during the decay of radioisotopes differ in significant ways, proper selection of isotope and antibody combinations is crucial to making radioimmunotherapy a standard therapeutic modality. Because of the short pathlength (50–80 $\mu$m) and high linear energy transfer (∼100 keV/$\mu$m) of $\alpha$-emitting radioisotopes, targeted $\alpha$-particle therapy offers the potential for more specific tumor cell killing with less damage to surrounding normal tissues than $\beta$-emitters. These properties make targeted $\alpha$-particle therapy ideal for the elimination of minimal residual or micrometastatic disease. Radioimmunotherapy using $\alpha$-emitters such as 213Bi, 211At, and 225Ac has shown activity in several in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and activity of targeted $\alpha$-particle therapy in the treatment of small-volume and cytoreduced disease. Further advances will require investigation of more potent isotopes, new sources and methods of isotope production, improved chelation techniques, better methods for pharmacokinetic and dosimetric modeling, and new methods of isotope delivery such as pretargeting. Treatment of patients with less-advanced disease and, ultimately, randomized trials comparing targeted $\alpha$-particle therapy with standard approaches will be required to determine the clinical utility of this approach.},

abstract = {FLYCHK is a straightforward, rapid tool to provide ionization and population distributions of plasmas in zero dimension with accuracy sufficient for most initial estimates and in many cases is applicable for more sophisticated analysis. FLYCHK solves rate equations for level population distributions by considering collisional and radiative atomic processes. The code is designed to be straightforward to use and yet is general enough to apply for most laboratory plasmas. Further, it can be applied for low-to-high Z ions and in either steady-state or time-dependent situations. Plasmas with arbitrary electron energy distributions, single or multiple electron temperatures can be studied as well as radiation-driven plasmas. To achieve this versatility and accuracy in a code that provides rapid response we employ schematic atomic structures, scaled hydrogenic cross-sections and read-in tables. It also employs the jj configuration averaged atomic states and oscillator strengths calculated using the Dirac–Hartree–Slater model for spectrum synthesis. Numerous experimental and calculational comparisons performed in recent years show that FLYCHK provides meaningful estimates of ionization distributions, well within a charge state for most laboratory applications.},

abstract = {Differences in the pattern of organization of organisms may lead to different patterns of evolution, genetics and ecology, Plants and animals differ in their fundamental patterns of organization. Plants consist of a series of repeating units that compete with one another, while animals consist of mutually interdependent systems that cannot compete. As a result, plants may be able to take advantage of somatic mutations in ways that are not available to animals. Somatic mutations arising in plants can be inherited by naturally occurring mechanisms of sexual and asexual reproduction. Long life span, large clone size, and the complete regeneration of buds each year may permit an indivdual plant or clone to evolve. Plants may even develop as mosaics of genetic variation. Evolution by individual plants and/or development as mosaics of genetic variation may prevent herbivores from breaking the defenses of their host plants. This evolution may also result in greater “fine tuning” to local environments leading to ecotypic variation.},

abstract = {The evaluated experimental data are presented for 14 known nuclides of mass 89 (Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh). New data on high-spin excitations are available for 89Kr, 89Rb, 89Sr, 89Tc and 89Ru, including a superdeformed structure in 89Tc. Fluorescence studies in 89Y have revealed a large number of new levels in 7-11 MeV range. New two-neutron transfer data are available for 89Zr. New direct and precise measurement of atomic masses of 89Se, 89Br, 89Kr, 89Rb, 89Mo and 89Tc have greatly improved the Q value landscape in this mass region. This work supersedes previous A=89 evaluation published in 1998Si31, and also the older ones 1989Si20, 1975Ko21, and M.W. Johns et al., Nuclear Data Tables A 8, 373 (1970).In spite of extensive experimental work on the isobaric nuclei of this mass chain several deficiencies remain. The identification of 89Rh isotope remains unconfirmed. The half-lives of ground states of 89Ge, 89As and 89Rh have not been measured, only the lower limits are estimated from time-of-flight in a reaction and experimental arrangement, where produced and identified. The decay schemes of 89Ge, 89As, 89Se, 89Ru and 89Rh are not known, and those for 89Tc and 89Mo are incomplete. High-lying (neutron unbound) levels in 89Kr, expected to be populated in the decay of 89Br, have not been investigated. The spins and parities for levels in 89Kr are largely unassigned, while for 89Tc and 89Ru, only few low-spin excitations are established. For 89Rb, little information is available for high-spin structures. Detailed gamma-ray data are available for 88Sr(n,??)89Sr reaction, but most of these ?? rays remain unassigned in a level scheme. Excited state data are nonexistent for 89Ge, 89As, 89Se, 89Br and 89Rh. The 89Y and 89Zr are the most extensively studied nuclei in A=89. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPr) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) are two identifying biomarkers expressed in very high numbers on prostate cancer cells and could serve as a useful tool for molecular targeting and diagnosis of disease via positron-emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to produce the multipurpose, bivalent [DUPA-6-Ahx-(64Cu-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] radioligand for prostate cancer imaging, where DUPA=(2-[3-(1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-ureido]pentanedioic acid), a small-molecule, PSMA-targeting probe, 6Ahx=6-aminohexanoic acid, 5-Ava=5-aminovaleric acid, NODAGA=[2-(4,7-biscarboxymethyl)-1,4,7-(triazonan-1-yl)pentanedioic acid] (a derivative of NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid)), and BBN(7-14)NH2=bombesin, a GRPr-specific peptide targeting probe. Methods: The PSMA/GRPr dual targeting ligand precursor [DUPA-6-Ahx-K-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2], was synthesized by solid-phase and manual peptide synthesis, after which NODAGA was added via manual conjugation to the ??-amine of lysine (K). The new bivalent GRPr/PSMA targeting vector was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), characterized by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and metallated with 64CuCl2 and natCuCl2. The receptor binding affinity was evaluated in human, prostate, PC-3 (GRPr-positive) and LNCaP (PSMA-positive) cells and the tumor-targeting efficacy determined in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and athymic nude mice bearing PC-3 and LNCaP tumors. Whole-body maximum intensity microPET/CT images of PC-3/LNCaP tumor-bearing mice were obtained 18h post-injection (p.i.). Results: Competitive binding assays in PC-3 and LNCaP cells indicated high receptor binding affinity for the [DUPA-6-Ahx-(natCu-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] conjugate. MicroPET scintigraphy in PC-3/LNCaP tumor-bearing mice indicated that xenografted tumors were visible at 18h p.i. with collateral, background radiation also being observed in non-target tissue. Conclusions: DUPA-6-Ahx-(64Cu-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] targeting vector, as described herein, is the first example of a dual GRPr-/PSMA-targeting radioligand for molecular of imaging prostate tumors. Detailed in vitro studies and microPET molecular imaging investigations of [DUPA-6-Ahx-(64Cu-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2 in tumor-bearing mice indicate that further studies are necessary to optimize uptake and retention of tracer in GRPr- and PSMA-positive tissues. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {The increasing significance of non-standard positron emission tomography (PET) nuclides in medicine is briefly outlined. The decay data of those radionuclides are generally well known, except for the positron emission intensity (Ibeta+) in a few cases. The recent precise measurements on the Ibeta+ values for (64)Cu, (76)Br, (120)I and (124)I are described. Some general aspects of cyclotron production of radionuclides are discussed. The need of some fundamental nuclear chemistry research with regard to the development of a new production route is demonstrated. An accurate knowledge of the excitation function of a nuclear reaction is essential to optimize the production route. The yield of a product calculated from the excitation function of a reaction gives the maximum achievable yield. Such yields are given for 24 radionuclides presently attracting attention. The experimental yields are always lower than the theoretical values, calling upon constant improvements in targetry and chemical processing procedures. Many of the non-standard PET nuclides, like (64)Cu, (86)Y, (94m)Tc, (124)I, etc. are produced in good yields at low energy cyclotrons while for production of some other radionuclides (e.g. 52Fe, 73Se, 83Sr, etc.) an intermediate energy cyclotron is required.},

New high-spin data are available for 62Ga, and 62Zn. Results of in-beam $\gamma$-ray studies for 62Cu producing high-spin states are in conflict in terms of gamma-ray placements and branching ratios. In the opinion of the evaluators, a detailed study of high-spin structures in 62Cu is needed to obtain a consistent and confident level scheme. Precise studies of superallowed $\beta$ decay of 62Ga to 62Zn by several groups have extended the decay scheme. No significant new data, since the 2000 NDS for A = 62 (2000Hu18), have been reported for 62Co, 62Ni and 62Cu.

The present study aims to develop statine-based bombesin receptor antagonists suitable for labeling with 64Cu for imaging by positron emission tomography (PET). The potent GRPr antagonist d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 was conjugated to the sarcophagine (3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo[6.6.6] icosane = Sar) derivative 5-(8-methyl-3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaaza-bicyclo[6.6.6]icosan-1-ylamino)-5-oxopentanoic acid (MeCOSar) via PEG4 (LE1) and PEG2 (LE2) spacers and radiolabeled with 64Cu2+ with >95\% yield and specific activities of about 100 MBq/nmol. Both Cu(II) conjugates have high affinity for GRPr (IC50: natCu-LE1, 1.4 ± 0.1 nM; natCu-LE2, 3.8 ± 0.6 nM). The antagonistic properties of both conjugates were confirmed by Ca2+-flux measurements. Biodistribution studies of Cu-64-LE1 exhibited specific targeting of the tumor (19.6 ± 4.7\% IA/g at 1 h p.i.) and GRPr-positive organs. Biodistribution and PET images at 4 and 24 h postinjection showed increasing tumor-to-background ratios with time. This was illustrated by the acquisition of PET images showing high tumor-to-normal tissue contrast. This study demonstrates the high affinity of the MeCOSar-PEGx-bombesin conjugates to GRPr. The stability of 64Cu complexes of MeCOSar, the long half-life of 64Cu, and the suitable biodistribution profile of the 64Cu-labeled peptides lead to PET images of high contrast suitable for potential translation into the clinic.},

abstract = {The 7.2-h half life radiohalogen (211)At offers many potential advantages for targeted $\alpha$-particle therapy; however, its use for this purpose is constrained by its limited availability. Astatine-211 can be produced in reasonable yield from natural bismuth targets via the (209)Bi( $\alpha$,2n)(211)At nuclear reaction utilizing straightforward methods. There is some debate as to the best incident $\alpha$-particle energy for maximizing (211)At production while minimizing production of (210)At, which is problematic because of its 138.4-day half life $\alpha$-particle emitting daughter, (210)Po. The intrinsic cost for producing (211)At is reasonably modest and comparable to that of commercially available (123)I. The major impediment to (211)At availability is attributed to the need for a medium energy $\alpha$-particle beam for its production. On the other hand, there are about 30 cyclotrons in the world that have the beam characteristics required for (211)At production.},

abstract = {(On behalf of the JUNO Collaboration) The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is an underground 20 kton liquid scintillator detector being built in the south of China and expected to start data taking in 2020. JUNO has a physics programme focused on neutrino properties using electron anti-neutrinos emitted from two near-by nuclear power plants. Its primary aim is to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy from the ${{\bar{\nu}_e}}$ oscillation pattern. With an unprecedented relative energy resolution of 3$\%$ as target, JUNO will be able to do so with a statistical significance of 3-4 $\sigma$ within six years of running. It will also measure other oscillation parameters to an accuracy better than 1$\%$. An ambitious experimental programme is in place to develop and optimize the detector and the calibration system, to maximize the light yield and minimize energy biases. JUNO will also be in a good position to study neutrinos from the sun and the earth and from supernova explosions, as well as provide a large acceptance for the search for proton decay. JUNO's physics potential was described and the status of its construction reviewed in my talk at the conference.},

abstract = {Abstract The detonation of a terrorist nuclear weapon in the United States would result in the massive loss of life and grave economic damage. Even if a device was not detonated, its known or suspected presence aboard a cargo container ship in a U.S. port would have major economic and political consequences. One possible means to prevent this threat would be to board a ship at sea and search for the device before it reaches port. The scenario considered here involves a small Coast Guard team with strong intelligence boarding a container ship to search for a nuclear device. Using active interrogation, the team would nonintrusively search a block of shipping containers to locate the fissile material. Potential interrogation source and detector technologies for the team are discussed. The methodology of the scan is presented along with a technique for calculating the required interrogation source strength using computer simulations. {MCNPX} was used to construct a computer model of a container ship, and several search scenarios were simulated. The results of the simulations are presented in terms of the source strength required for each interrogation scenario. Validation measurements were performed in order to scale these simulation results to expected performance. Interrogations through the short (2.4&#xa0;m) axis of a standardized shipping container appear to be feasible given the entire range of container loadings tested. Interrogations through several containers at once or a single container through its long (12.2&#xa0;m) axis do not appear to be viable with a portable interrogation system. },

abstract = {Gas bubbles introduced into a liquid in the mixing chamber help to break up the liquid into fine droplets on being expanded to the ambient pressure. The passage of gas bubbles through the orifice of the nozzle requires that the size of the bubbles be much smaller than the diameter of the orifice. In the present work, the effectiveness of 20. kHz ultrasound to increase number density of fine bubbles within the mixing chamber of an effervescent atomizer by breaking up bubbles introduced in it by an aerator was investigated. Bubbles of initial size in the range of 5-10. mm were shown to get disintegrated into clusters of micron and sub-micron sized bubbles. A fine spray was produced in the presence of ultrasound at a gas-to-liquid mass flowrate ratio (GLR) of 0.063%. The half-cone angle of spray was in the range of 6-10°, which compares favorably with conventional atomizers. The experimental findings of bubble breakup were theoretically modeled by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. The results of the model indicate that bubbles having initial radius less than 3. mm undergo growth and subsequent disintegration at 20. kHz for the given acoustic pressure of 0.3. MPa. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {At low excitation energies a "constant nuclear temperature" representation of nuclear-level densities is used, and at high excitation energies the regular Fermi gas formula is adopted. A method is developed for determining the parameters of the Fermi gas formula by using both the pairing and the shell-correction energies found by Cameron and Elkin for their semiempirical atomic mass formula in its exponential form. This procedure determines level densities at neutron-binding-energy excitations subject to an average factor error of 1.8. Methods are also developed for determining the parameters for the lower-energy formula in such a way that it best fits the lower-energy levels and joins smoothly to the Fermi gas formula. Correlations of the resulting parameters with shell and pairing effects are found. A composite prescription is given for calculating level densities in nuclei for which no experimental information is known. Tables give level density parameters for a wide variety of nuclei for which some experimental information is known. Some of the derivations of the Fermi gas formula in the literature were found to be slightly incorrect, so new derivations are presented in Appendixes.},

The wet chemical isolation of trace quantities of 211At, produced within several grams of Bi metal deposited onto an aluminum cyclotron target assembly, involves a multi-step procedure. Because the 211At isolation method is labor-intensive and complex, automation of the method is being developed to facilitate routine processing at the University of Washington and to make it easier to transfer the process to other institutions. As part of that automation effort, a module useful in the initial step of the isolation procedure, dissolution of the Bi target, was designed and tested. The computer-controlled module performs in-line dissolution of Bi metal from the target assembly using an enclosed target dissolution block, routing the resulting solubilized 211At/Bi mixture to the subsequent process step. The primary parameters involved in Bi metal solubilization (influent HNO3 concentration and flow rate) were optimized prior to evaluation of the system using replicate 211At-bearing cyclotron irradiated targets. The results indicate that the system performs in a predictable and reproducible manner, with cumulative Bi and 211At recoveries following a sigmoidal function.},

Measured data were critically compared with the earlier reported values, and also with the theoretical data from the TALYS and ALICE-IPPE codes. The measured natTi(p,x)48V reaction is important for charged particle beam monitoring purposes, whereas the 43,44,47Sc radionuclide have various practical applications in nuclear medicine. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Martiniova2016,
abstract = {Over the past several years, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agents labeled with 68Gallium (68Ga) have undergone a significant increase in clinical utilization. 68Ga is conveniently produced from a germanium-68/gallium-68 (68Ge/68Ga) generator. Because of the compact size and ease of use of the generator, 68Ga labeled compounds may be more cost-effective than PET radioisotopes that are cyclotron-produced. The convenient half-life of 68Ga (T1/2=68 min) provides sufficient radioactivity for various PET imaging applications, while delivering acceptable radiation doses to patients. This chapter summarizes the emerging clinical utilization of 68Ga-based radiotracers in medical imaging.},

abstract = {Abstract Excitation functions for the production of 52Fe in the bombardment of Mn and Ni with protons were measured from threshold up to 200 MeV. Production rates of 52Fe as well as of its 55Fe and 59Fe impurities were also measured in specific energy windows ranging up to 100 MeV. The agreement with previous measurements, where available, is reasonably good, except that considerably higher 55Fe contamination levels than those recently reported below 70 MeV were obtained in the case of Ni. The experimental results were compared with theoretical calculations by means of the computer code ALICE/85/300. Overall agreement to within a factor of two was obtained, and the usefulness of the code in planning a radioisotope production process was demonstrated. Finally, practical production rates and impurity levels, obtained with a 66 MeV proton beam at high intensities (∼50 $\mu$A), are reported.},

@article{Ditroi2008,
abstract = {Abstract Niobium is a metal with important technological applications: use as alloying element to increase strength of super alloys, as thin layer for tribological applications, as superconductive material, in high temperature engineering systems, etc. In the frame of a systematic study of activation cross-sections of charged particle induced reactions on structural materials proton induced excitation functions on Nb targets were determined with the aim of applications in accelerator and reactor technology and for thin layer activation (TLA). The charged particle activation cross-sections on this element are also important for yield calculation of medical isotope production (88,89Zr,86,87,88Y) and for dose estimation in PET targetry. As Niobium is a monoisotopic element it is an ideal target material to test nuclear reaction theories. We present here the integral excitation functions of 93Nb(p,x)90,93mMo, 92m,91m,90Nb, 86,88,89Zr, 86,87mg,88Y and 85Sr in the energy range 30–70MeV, some measured for the first time at this energy range. The results were compared with the theoretical cross-sections calculated by means of the code ALICE-IPPE and with the literature data. The calculations have been carried out without any parameter adjustment. The theory reproduces the shape of the measured results well and magnitude is also acceptable. Thick target yields calculated from our fitted cross-section give reliable estimations for production of medically relevant radioisotopes and for dose estimation in accelerator technology.},
